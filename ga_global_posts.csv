Email Hunter  pros: -super easy to use -great for beginners -cheap  cons: -high bounce rate -50% of the time there won't be an email listed  It's worth starting on, if you haven't bought a lot of data before.  2. LinkedIn Sales Navigator  pros: -complete and accurate data -everybody is on LinkedIn  cons: -it doesn't give you the email address of your prospect. LinkedIn wants you to connect with them through their platform  Sales Navigator is good in combination with something like Email Hunter to identify the actual prospect.  3. ZoomInfo  pros: -best value -great enterprise data -complete info on your prospects  cons: -expensive ($400-$500 a month and you have to buy for a full year)  The one I've gotten the most value from, but is also the most expensive.  Summary: Start with Email Hunter. If it works, perfect, it's cheap. Then add Sales Navigator and us it in combination with Email Hunter to get that high quality data.

1.27E+17,"I just reached 10,000 connections! It took a while but let me explain what I did.   Here are a few tips to help you get that many connections.   1) Upgrade to Sales Navigator. You can search more people and Linkedin is more lenient with those that pay for their platform.   2) Join groups with your target market and start conversations. When other people comment on your discussion in a group and the group has a lot of engagement, many people will see it. Those people will click on your profile and likely want to connect.   3) Use an automated software to share content with your target market. When you search people, you can auto connect with a lot of your prospects and share valuable content. Be sure not to spam and make sure you are not connecting with more then 100 people a day.   4) Write content using status updates and articles. When people like and share your artilces or status updates, all their connections will see it. Those connections will likely reach out to you.   There is more... But use those for now and you will do  great. ",189,10,4,80,227,2010,1,19251,SSG Pro,78,sales,2012,2,86,24,17.6,19.06,25

Martinez Jr., Jamie Shanks, and Kurt Shaver?  It is our view that all our graduates will need to be social selling capable to complete in the current world of sales.  Thus we do use a SSI as a proxy for social selling mastery in our program.  Our students, at all levels of our program, should know their score and are taught how to use Sales Navigator.   We are working to develop modules to discuss social network theory and how essential it is to develop and provide value to your professional network to be effective in today's marketplace.   ON Friday of this week, we will recognize our student who have achieved social selling competency as well as award the top 5 social seller in Boot camp.  Congrats to Jordan T.

As an avid LinkedIn user since my early college days, it's been fun seeing LinkedIn grow from an online resume to its current state as a complete platform that sales organizations are building around in four major ways:  1) Deepening marketing and sales alignment. As a salesperson, have you ever felt like there isn't an easy way to enable marketing to target the leads and accounts you actually care about? That's solved by connecting Sales Navigator to LinkedIn Campaign manager.  2) Data centralization: Don't have a streamlined view of customer data across your various sales tools? Sales Navigator Application Platform integrates Sales Navigator across the Business Intelligence, Marketing Automation, eSignature, Web Conference, CRM and Sales Acceleration tools you already use.  3) Sales leader pipeline management and visibility: Wish you had a dashboard showing updated trigger events on your key deals, so you could coach your team and improve forecast accuracy? Check out Dealbook.  4) Sales Ops & sales teams: Do you spend time, energy and resources on improving CRM data accuracy?

Even at a ""risk-averse"" company, EY embraced a modern approach head-on, rather than avoiding change management.  2) ""We wanted marketing to see the value of the platform and really help in getting the word out,"" so EY gave access to many marketing departments. Great example of what world-class sales and marketing alignment looks like.  3) ""There's a maintenance process that goes into relationship building and the sales triggers really help with that. You don’t just want to be there when it’s time to buy, you want to be there in between; building the credibility and confidence during the non-sales times.""  4) When her team would say: ""I already know everyone at my accounts,"" Danielle would ask: ""Didn’t they just acquire x company?

1.25E+17,"Really interesting lunch yesterday with Steven Etzler of the Business Development Institute and marketing leaders here in New York.  There is so much opportunity for companies who learn how to communicate and collaborate effectively internally across functions.  From my experience, sales complain that marketing does not understand what is needed, in terms of content, to drive new business deals through the sales cycle and deepen relationships with existing accounts.  From my experience, sales cannot articulate exactly what they need to marketing. Nor can they provide marketing with the right people for ABM to be truly effective. Marketing is often just provided with a list of random names and then complain that marketing is adding no value.  Here’s the deal. Many sales people have never been taught how to conduct effective account planning into their accounts. They don't know how to conduct the right research, and then find, relate and engage with the right people deep and wide within a target account across the consensus purchase.

Connected with some people leading the platform's growth like Daniel, Colin and Manu. 3 LinkedIn insights from it below:  1) Treat your local connections carefully  When sorting through connection requests, pay extra attention to people based in your city. Is there any way you can collaborate? Local networks are key.  2) LinkedIn's back-end (sales navigator etc) is powerful  Sales navigator's ability to target almost anyone in granular detail is, as of right now, totally unmatched. No other social platform offers it, making it an unfair advantage for many sales teams.  3) Right now, LinkedIn is red hot  If you're not spending most of your social media time on LinkedIn, you should be. Everyone was in agreement that there's nowhere else better to build your brand and spread your message than right here.   This last point confirmed what I'd also seen - LinkedIn has been growing massively recently, and it's showing no signs of slowing.   Great way to end my first day working in NYC.

1.23E+17,"Workflow question for all you Sales Navigator gurus.   I've just started using the Pro version. I can't connect it to my CRM (don't have SFDC or Dynamics) and don't have team/enterprise version.   So for you #sales pros doing outbound prospecting without an integrated CRM, how are you managing your workflow?   Best practices recommend a cadence of 9-12 touches using a mix of InMails, Connection Requests, direct emails, and phone calls.   So how are you keeping track of those touches?  It's only been a week, and I'm already losing track of where I am with each prospect.   Responses are getting buried. Prospects are falling through the cracks.   Message threads are hard to keep track of. Some message threads appear in Sales Navigator, some in the regular LinkedIn interface.   Do you manually enter the leads into your separate CRM?  How do you track/manage the workflow and cadence to ensure you're touching them enough to get a response before moving on?   How many leads do you work in a batch?   Would deeply appreciate tips, but please don't try to sell me a service. I'm not looking to outsource this and don't want to sign up for a training course.

A mindset that drives you to continually seek out and welcome new connections will greatly assist your efforts in facilitating lead generation. Dedicate your free time to expanding your network, and remember that even someone who doesn’t profile as a prospective customer can be valuable to know.  3. Seek out qualified buyers.

9.54E+16,"LinkedIn has been making a lot of improvements to the experience of being on LinkedIn lately.  But one thing I still haven't seen a lot of value or changes on are Skill Endorsements on our profiles.  I have a lot of them on my profile, and see many on other people's profiles and I've come to realize that you really have to manage them to keep them accurate. Sometimes new skills get added that aren't even relevant to what you do that need to be removed, i'm not even sure how that happens.  Since we know that endorsements can just be added, and people can endorse us for skills that we may or may not have, as well as endorse us when they don't even really know if we have the skill, where is the real value then of the feature?  I've read that recruiters don't trust or use them for that reason, sales professionals don't use them for prospects (they're not even searchable in Sales Navigator) and since they are at the bottom of your profile, there is a good chance most people may never see them.   With this being the case, you might think that LinkedIn could enhance them to actually be valuable or just remove them altogether.

LeadIQ = unlimited emails & unlimited exporting to CRM.  2) LeadIQ is less expensive so you get more leads for less $  3) ZoomInfo has direct dials, but how often to people answer their desk phone? Sure, LeadIQ has direct dials, but our data is even stronger for cell phones. So our customers have a 3x higher connect rate on cold calls.  4) LeadIQ can capture entire LinkedIn search results page (25 leads on Sales Navigator, 10 leads on free LinkedIn) with 1 click. With ZoomInfo reps have to capture leads 1 at a time = inefficient.  5) LeadIQ is real-time data capture so if someone changes a job we already have their new contact info. ZoomInfo is more a of static database, lags behind. People change jobs more frequently than ever, so this is huge.  6) With LeadIQ capture leads for people who liked your LinkedIn post.

It really was impressive and enlightening.   As somebody whose first #sales contract was signed on slate with a charcoal pencil by the light of an oil lamp, I was struck by two things: 1) It’s never been easier to get information on prospective Customers into the hands of salespeople. 2) None of it matters without competent salespeople.  And none of it matters without sales leaders who actually adopt these systems and who LEAD their salespeople. Technology makes it too easy to sit behind a desk staring at weak pipeline reports and wondering why your people aren't making their numbers.   My $.02??????

Each time, Brian said something new and by the end of the night I had created a new sales strategy for myself (and a new LinkedIn profile!) His professionalism and efficiency as a salesperson inspires me. One of the things he mentioned was that if he notices a successful sales person, he would go to them, ask how they are currently achieving success, and implement the same techniques. Not all techniques will work for the same person but often times you’ll find something that works for you in the process. Well, Brian - I’ll be taking all the wonderful techniques you shared and use them throughout the second half of this semester!

I plan on buying the store from him and my mother in law  retire in peace.   Here are the 2 ways to start reaching out to your dream client:  1) Start using linkedin as an incredible research tool when you reach out to business owners. Showing that you have done the research not only impresses the potential customer but quickens the sales process and gets their attention.  Mention things like school, degrees, interests, and past shares on  the potential clients profile.   2) There is a way to find all the decision makers within the company and motivate them to talk to the main decision maker. By using sales navigator, you can find all the people with specific positions in a company. Sometimes your dream client needs to be coerced by the people around him. By messaging everyone with a specified message asking them to pass along a message to the main guy in charge, you can get that persons attention real quick.",223,10,4,80,227,2010,1,19251,SSG Pro,78,sales,2012,2,86,24,17.6,19.06,25

9.68E+16,After wondering for years why anyone would pay a dime for LinkedIn - I ponied up for a paid Sales Navigator.   1. It is like LinkedIn without all the connections to people you don’t know because YOU select who shows in your feed.   2. Easily uncover job changes at the executive level.   3. Uncover great content shares from important people and bypass a lot of promotional posts.   4. Follow companies that are leads to uncover changes and new staff.   5.  See at a glance which of your followed companies are growing and which are shrinking by employee count %.  6. None of my competitors seem to do this  Downside:  1. Expensive - around $800 yearly  2. Paid status seems to attract some users who know that if you’re paying you are paying attention to LinkedIn.   3.  The pricing and features are really hidden within LinkedIn and not easy to find.   4.  There are cheaper levels I may be able to take advantage of in the future.   5.  LinkedIn is still very much “recruiter city” and if they don’t continue to pay attention to other areas I’ll likely reconsider when renewal time approaches.,192,7,25,4,227,1986,1,1798,SSG Pro,73,sales,2006,4,83,23.77,19.01,15.69,24.8

Did you even know LinkedIn has a SOCIAL SELLING INDEX (SSI)??    I've been on LinkedIn since 2010 and only recently found out about this!  @Melonie Dodaro has a great article breaking it all down, I'll leave a link in the comments.  By checking out your SSI, you'll see how you stack up against your industry peers and your network on LinkedIn. Further, you can see how you are performing on each of the four elements of social selling -- establishing your professional brand, finding the right people, engaging with insights, and building relationships -- and track your progress over time to help you understand how you're improving.  Check out your social selling index score here: https://lnkd.in/f_JKb33  Comment with your own SSI score, and what you think you can do to increase it!

Definition: Management is the function that coordinates the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives by using available resources efficiently and effectively.  Process: Management has 5 key tasks, being: • Planning • Organising • Staffing • Directing  • Controlling  Take a moment to think about this process cycle: Are you spending time on all tasks? Where are your strengths in this process? On a scale of 1-5 (5 being mastery) where would you score in each task?  Ask yourself: Why am I behaving like this?

9.71E+16,"How to improve B2B sales by deploying Dynamics 365 for sales with LinkedIn Sales navigator Social Selling  Social selling has reached new level of importance in recent years as it creates platform for sales people to use social media to connect and interact directly with the prospects. Sales people understand the customer behavior and provide thoughtful and meaningful suggestions throughout the buying journey until the customer is ready to buy. Thus social selling allows the sales people to delight there prospects with content and permission marketing rather than interrupt their daily lives with cold calls and hard sells.  LinkedIn – The world’s largest professional network  LinkedIn is the most effective social selling network in the planet, with more than 530 million users in more than 200 countries and every two second 2 new LinkedIn accounts are created.  While Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat are valuable tools to learn more about your prospect’s interests and personality, these platforms are good to research about the prospect before reaching out, LinkedIn is typically the only platform that directly leads to new business.

I did find a few interesting facts:  .- I have connections in 111 countries .- 40% of my network is based out of English speaking countries and 28% in Spanish speaking ones. .- More than 55% of my network is comprised by people working in the IT industry .- A solid 66% of my network works in sales, marketing or related activities. .- Entrepreneurs and consultants (working for themselves, as in not working for other people) represent 23% of my network. .- For some 78% of the people in my network, it's been less than 4 years since we connected.   I then decided to organize connections by continent. It made more sense than just by country.

Smart inbox replies: When you’re on the go, (or simply feeling lazy) this feature helps you reply with a single click/touch.  2. Website demographics: Add a simple LinkedIn insight tag code on your landing page(s) & get sick analytics on who’s visiting those sites. Epic for optimizing your LI ads & understanding your audience.  3. Improved mobile search: Find anybody on LinkedIn that’s used a specific keyword or short phrase in an update. #boom  4. LinkedIn Sales Navigator search filters: Let’s get something straight. Sales Navigator is a MUST-HAVE in every sales stack. Their filters will help you find & engage with decision makers, influencers, & champions 24/7.  5. Newsfeed video updates: Whether you love them or hate them, you’ve already consumed video updates on your LinkedIn newsfeed.  6. Sharing multiple photos: Add 9 images & share them all in a single status update.  7. Improved inMail features: LinkedIn quietly improved their inMail features. Too long to cover in here, so ping me for the inside scoop.   8. Newsfeed customization: Mute, update, & improve what you want to read, consume, & get notified about.

All endorsements received and given lost.  Relationship work of years down the drain. When your #SSI nose-dives from 86% to 72% within a few days, you know something is going terribly wrong.   Since there is no way to get in touch with a person on the phone, I had to wait for response via the Helpcenter. During the process I was asked to change my password. Three times. Identify myself with passport and ID.  My account is still not fully restored.  Seems that the Helpcenter cannot easily resolve the issues or just roll back my profile to what it was.   As for many of you LinkedIn and Sales Navigator are part of what you do, engaging with experts, clients, colleagues.

Just as few personal note after reading the blog, mostly things I don't quite agree with but I invite you to read the article first and then come back to this post and re-read the following:  1. Industry DOES determine success rates when reaching out to potential buyers, as much as market type/size. Sales Navigator will not produce the same results in all industries.  2. B2C is possible through Sales Navigator. Banking and Insurance are both very good proof of it. The question is: how scalable is it?  3. The uplift in the win rates mentioned in the blog seem to be a direct impact of using sales navigator...but it is very hard to actually prove that that only happens to reps just because they use SN.   As a quick wrap-up note: I love this kind of content. It shows that LinkedIn is learning at the same pace we all are. Social Selling / Digital Sales is way more than just one or 2 solutions.

7.93E+16,"My favorite Sales Navigator feature is PointDrive. It's simple to use and great to measure customer / reader interaction (without depending on Mkt / Email automation tools). As easy as lather, rinse, repeat. You can create, copy and share within a team, leveraging knowledge and presentations already there. You can see who's opening each piece of content you curate for them and see how much time they spend doing it. We've been using it for multi-touch campaigns and also for internal communications. It's even replaced our new hire checklist in some divisions. Every time a new rep joins I'll just send them the PD link with the materials they need to go through on their first couple of weeks. We use it the same way with customers: we have our ""first contact"" pd, our ""let's meet, here's why"" pd, and so on.  In a nutshell: it's changed the way we communicate.   #RealSales ",152,3,25,96,11,1998,1,20314,SSG Pro,84,sales,2004,2,88,24.9,18.65,19.61,25

This is my feedback concerning Sales Navigator and LinkedIn Pulse.   Eavan Healy If your role covers Sales Navigator.  And Daniel Roth  and Isabelle Roughol because you oversee LinkedIn publishing platform but Africa is clearly MIA.  These are my recommendations:   - The way sales navigator work, it may seem great for people in the West, but after using it, it's a bit limiting. Add multiple lead lists. A particular lead may be responsible for different opportunities.  There are African writers who can contribute to LinkedIn pulse we don't have to be Influencers. Also, with a committed editor that covers only the African market, it's easier to get great articles featured on LinkedIn publishing platform  These are just a few.  Thanks for listening.

More than 80% of the Forbes Cloud 100 use Sales Navigator in their Sales process.  #SalesNav traditionally had a Startup offering vibe to it. There was little clarity on launch cycles, road-map of development, pre-release training etc. It also merely integrated a couple of systems, instead of working seamlessly with dozens of #SalesTech apps that Sales Reps use.  This is all about to change!  LinkedIn has announced that here forward, Sales Navigator updates will be issued on a quarterly cycle to provide advanced communications and training for administrators and users so they have adequate time to familiarise themselves with new features and leverage them.

1.33E+17,"Is #LinkedIn #SalesNavigator Worth It? ... I was asked this question by the Sales Leader of a Tech firm earlier today. He is leading a 20 strong sales team in Au/NZ. It was a good 1-hour chat over coffee. In my opinion, #SocialSelling is bigger than #LinkedIn. However, #LinkedIn is the centrepiece of B2B Social Selling. #Twitter is an excellent Social Selling tool. #Google has its own benefits. However, #LinkedIn is the centrepiece. LinkedIn's professional product for Sales - 'Sales Navigator' is a very small investment to make (about $100 a month per sales rep) for a mammoth return. $5/day to ensure that the sales professional is working with the right accounts and the right contacts at the right time in the right way. No-Brainer really.  So Yes, Social Selling extends beyond the LinkedIn platform (way beyond), but without Sales Nav you are missing the CORE, the ENGINE, the SOUL of Social Selling.  So if you have 20 Sales Reps, LinkedIn Sales Nav is an investment of about $100/day across 20 people, but the return you will get for that investment is unbelievably high.

1.20E+17,"The power of LinkedIn is not solely in your 1st connections, it's also in your 2nd and 3rd connections. But only if you must have powerful, influential and well connected 1st connections in your industry and amongst your peers.  I have 10,300 1st Singaporean connections which leads me to being able to reach 2 million connections in Singapore through my 2nd and 3rd connections. There are 2.3m professionals on LinkedIn in Singapore, virtually everyone who is a white collar worker.   I can therefore reach 87% of everyone Singapore who is on LinkedIn.   As my late Grandad always told me, it's who you know not what you know. The power of the network is through your 1st connections.  When it comes to using Sales Navigator this is especially true. You need more 1st to be able to reach more 2nd and 3rd, but the right kind of 1st.   Saying yes more times than saying no will help you expand your network but check if the people you connect with have many shared connections with you, are in similar industries or are your peers and have a complete LinkedIn profile.  If you only have a few connections then you will only have a few 2nd connections and Sales Navigator simply will not work for you, especially if you also have an incomplete and out of date profile.   ",224,-9,-9,-9,194,1976,3,29903,SSG Team,99,general,2008,-9,89,24.7,19.16,20.28,25

Ok, that's 3 categories.  Actually, the third category probably has the most active users.  SO, if you're here for HIRING or getting B2B SALES, your ads will mostly be shown to people that are browsing LinkedIn in order to find latest trend in their industry, engage with other professionals etc...  That's why a direct response ad is very unlikely to perform well. Also, the fact that they have awful CPM and very low CTR doesn't help.  I tried both hiring and getting sales through LinkedIn, and every time Facebook ads were more effective, even for hunting CXOs and promoting Investment Funds.  That's when their second product comes into play: SALES NAVIGATOR  The targeting options are just as powerful as for their ad platform.

SN is epic by itself allowing you to create target lists, generates leads daily,  target people who have changed jobs, been in the news, actually posted as well as those following your company page within this saved search criteria.   PD takes social selling to the next level.  PD allows you to upload up to 10 presentations, videos, PDFs,  infographics, photos, white papers, whatever you want a potential client to see.  You can then include the PD link from this marketing content in your sales message on SN and elsewhere (e.g. I use it in my email signature).   You can then track who has accessed the content and downloaded it and LinkedIn tells you by email, (see graphic of me viewing my own content to demonstrate).  You can then see on PD how much of the deck someone has viewed for how long and who they are. You can then engage with that person knowing that they are interested in your content.

Seasoned LinkedIn pros will know what I'm talking about: Sales Navigator.   If the newsfeed is the flashy singer getting all the attention, sales navigator is the savvy manager making all the decisions.  It may not get the exposure of your content, but sales navigator is incredibly powerful. There's nowhere else on the web where you can connect to almost any professional in real time, under one roof.  There's more than enough players to choose from too with over 550 million registered users which is growing by 2 new users joining every SECOND, and shows no signs of slowing.   I think sales navigator plays a huge part in LinkedIn's growth. You may not see it, but many people are using it daily to get leads for their business. We certainly do at Web Traffic That Works for our own lead generation and for all of our clients .  Let's shed some light on how to use it effectively.

1.30E+17,"“Why are my posts on LinkedIn getting NO traction?”  A question I get asked all the time.  When you share a status update it goes through a few stages based on LinkedIn’s algorithm.  First and foremost they check the quality of your content and label it as spam, low quality or clear.  Once it’s cleared LinkedIn will then send it to a small segment of your network to see how well it performs.  Based on the likes, comments and shares you get from this initial push, it will determine the popularity of your post.  The lower your score the less reach and vise versa.  If your post continues to get engagement it will be sent out to more of your network and so on...  Now the reason why you’re probably not getting traction is because your network is built up of people who:  a) Don’t know you b) Not your target market  Therefore the posts you put up aren’t relevant or targeted to get the early traction it needs.  So what’s the solution?  1. Get clear on your target market. 2. Use ‘Sales Navigator’ to search, find and connect with them. 3. Send invitations to that audience on a daily basis.  Over time this will ensure that you build a network that’s targeted and relevant.  As a result when you post up a piece of content your level of engagement will be much higher. ??",233,4,3,105,14,2008,1,21783,SSG Pro,65,sales,2006,3,81,17.75,20.48,18.06,25

Alex Pirouz, what do you think?   Few updates that you may find beneficial: 1) If you run a Sales Team  - Prospecting and contact regularity, and ability to sync with Salesforce to see the movement of the client is really good. - CRM-Like Functions are starting to come into Sales Navigator including where the team is with the actual contact AND the total deal amount  2) Wanting to do specialised campaigns to target markets:  (I think this is the best change)  - Ad Campaigns will integrate into Sales Navigator, so you can specifically put sponsored content to groups that you are targeting. - Best Part - if you are running a Sales Team - your business page can now specifically generate sponsored content to your sales team's pipeline.  Why this is a big deal?  The segmentation with LinkedIN in advertising is good, but no where near what Facebook can do.   B2B Biz - this is a massive move.   If Your sales reps don't go out of their way to nurture their pipeline - your content can.   3) InsideSales Integration - if you are running a call centre (mostly in the US), this is such a massive benefit. You can hook this into your phone system and automatically see the client contact sync via LinkedIN - on autodialler! ",226,10,4,-9,14,2003,2,3029,SSG Pro,72,sales,2013,-9,61,20.23,13.2,2.9,25

This will help you build a network of targeted contacts to position your content in front of.  2) Stay on topic, the key to getting reach on LinkedIn is engagement and the key to engagement is posting content that your target market want to like, comment or share.  Think about topics they would be excited to read about or can relate to. Then start writing posts around these topics.  3) Be vulnerable and raw in everything you write, don’t be afraid to express yourself. This is absolutely key to engagement and a must to build trust with your audience. Without engagement your reach will be limited.  4) Be patient, so many people give up before they even start. I averaged less than 1000 views per post when I first started. But I stayed at it and consistently posted week in week out.  Which tip was your favorite?

1.40E+17,"Should you pay for Sales Navigator? Is it worth it?  Well the answer is... it depends on how you use it.  I'm helping a few clients generate leads through Linkedin Sales Navigator at the moment, and the main difference I see is the level of detail at which you can search for people you want to connect with i.e prospects or potential strategic partners.  For instance, if you knew that your ideal client: - Is a Founder or Director for a small business - Has a team of 1-10 or 11-50 - Has been in the business for at least 3 years - Is part of a few specific Linkedin groups - In a specific location  Then Sales Navigator will allow you to narrow the search in on that target, and then save them as a lead, apply a tag based on where they are in your sales process. It's essentially a CRM tool.  That's what's only possible with the upgrade, and provided you're using the tool to help generate leads that turn into sales for your business - that covers the cost of investment.  If, however, you have no interest in using LinkedIn for sales purposes and you just want to publish content and build your thought leadership then you can stick with the free account and that's fine.  Are you using sales navigator? Why or why not?  #linkedin #sales ",231,3,15,80,14,2004,-9,3164,not an lss subscriber,77,non-subscriber,2007,2,84,23.4,18.96,16.75,25

1.30E+17,"So far this month I’ve had over 250K views on my posts.  If you’re struggling to get reach here’s my TOP 4 tips:  1) Get super clear on your target market and then use Sales Navigator to find, invite and connect with them. This will help you build a network of targeted contacts to position your content in front of.  2) Stay on topic, the key to getting reach on LinkedIn is engagement and the key to engagement is posting content that your target market want to like, comment or share.  Think about topics they would be excited to read about or can relate to. Then start writing posts around these topics.  3) Be vulnerable and raw in everything you write, don’t be afraid to express yourself. This is absolutely key to engagement and a must to build trust with your audience. Without engagement your reach will be limited.  4) Be patient, so many people give up before they even start. I averaged less than 1000 views per post when I first started. But I stayed at it and consistently posted week in week out.  Which tip was your favorite?

Sales Navigator has become so important to the Crane team, that it’s now a part of the way they evaluate sales reps. “There are five criteria we use with our salespeople in their quarterly reviews – new accounts, active accounts, etc.,” says Zubradt. “But one of those five is their Social Selling Index (SSI) score from Sales Navigator, and that’s because it encourages reps to boost their skills, not just their numbers.” By regularly checking their SSI scores and practicing the sales behaviors that will increase them, everyone on the team is improving their skill set and the way they drive business.  Zubradt says that, by connecting with multiple team members at an organization, he managed to maintain an account even after their primary contact left the company. “I went on Sales Navigator and found five other people to connect with, two of whom I was connected to through friends.

Map your account Using the Advanced Search and Lead Builder features in LinkedIn, you can search by company name, seniority level, functional area and key word to develop a list of potential decision makers. Often by a little inspection and research we can find out who the key person we need to meet with and learn about their background, and gather insight into who has influence in the organization.  2.	Messaging Using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, we can follow the company and capture the key decision makers as Leads, which will allow us to get individual “Lead Updates” and “Lead Shares” from these prospects. Our goal is to learn about what they are interested in and what they care about, gather clues and intelligence about the person and their business. This can help us develop key message and a value proposition that is unique to the prospect.  3.	Gain access  When you have a solid network on your LinkedIn account, you can simply click on ‘2nd degree connections’ within Sales Navigator to identify whom in your target audience is connected to your immediate network for an introduction.  ",197,3,26,-9,95,1997,2,1290,not an lss subscriber,61,non-subscriber,-9,-9,73,19.57,16.98,11.35,25

1.09E+17,"SALES NAVIGATOR GETS A MAKE OVER  Just watched this video from Brynne Tillman about a new redesign for Sales Navigator ( https://lnkd.in/dJwJmXP  ) Sales Navigator was beginning to look pretty dated so it's good to see LinkedIn is actively working on bringing it up to date. The bulk of the new design remains the same, obvious changes include a simpler menu bar and the addition of the standard LinkedIn Work Icon Grid giving access to other LinkedIn products such as groups,  advertising etc.  LinkedIn has also now incorporated Pointdrive a presentation application as a free addition for Sales Navigator Team users (generally used by Corporate sales team). There is better integration with CRM - which will again largely be of benefit to bigger companies  usings of Sales Force, MS Dynamics etc.  These users will be pleased with closer CRM integration especially the ability to save data back to the CRM system.  Clearly, the development of Sales Navigator is  driven by a focus on the needs of larger businesses,  smaller businesses will also benefit from  its continuing development.

You can search by location, current company, past company, industry, keywords etc. You can even search inside the connections of a 1st connection of yours (should they allow their 1st connections to view their connections).   What to do next?   Visit their profiles and identify if you wish to further communicate with them!   If you do, you could for example send them a customized invitation to connect, an Inmail (i.e. if you are a Premium or Sales Navigator Subscriber) or ask to be introduced to them via a common LinkedIn Connection. We could be lucky and our target prospect could have his/her contact information in a visible area of his LinkedIn Profile (this is suggested by the way), i.e. his/her email or work telephone number, which will make it easier for us to contact him/her.   Approaching them with the most effective message tailor made for each circumstance is vital at this point.

Get all your customers together, search each company then find out where previous employees have gone. When you connect with them reference their previous employer and the work you did for them. This has helped me open a number of doors. ",96,-9,-9,-9,78,2013,1,16271,SSG Team,35,sales,2013,-9,66,10.89,18.22,11.45,25
1.11E+17,"Tuned into (is that the right phrase?!) an interesting Social Selling webinar by Fullscope and Microsoft last week, hosted by Fullscope MD Adam Spurr.  They recently surveyed their customers who are using Dynamics (other CRM platforms are available!) integrated with LinkedIn's Sales Navigator.   The metrics are compelling  - Average increase in deal size is 35% (55% for top quartile) - Average increase in win rates is 5% (15% for top quartile) - Average increase in sourced opportunities is 34% (45% for top quartile)  Taking the average for the first metric above, the increase in revenue on 10 deals at a current average deal size of £20k would be £70k (10x£27k=£270k as opposed to 10x£20k=£200k)  That's probably worth consideration.  The essence of the increase is due to having a more complete view of who the potential buyers are in future customers and how to connect to them through your network.    If we equate a more strategic sale to playing chess, you wouldn't play chess with only being able to see one or two of the pieces (partial view).  That would be nonsense. You would want to see the whole board.  The complete view facilitates higher and wider engagement to build greater value and hence create bigger sales opportunities. All managed efficiently in CRM.            ",212,10,4,105,78,1992,1,1718,not an lss subscriber,61,non-subscriber,2004,-9,68,17.68,11.16,13.83,25

8.87E+16,"Don't forget to frequently utilize the powerful Search Engine of LinkedIn to zero in on your target prospects. You can search by location, current company, past company, industry, keywords etc. You can even search inside the connections of a 1st connection of yours (should they allow their 1st connections to view their connections).   What to do next?   Visit their profiles and identify if you wish to further communicate with them!   If you do, you could for example send them a customized invitation to connect, an Inmail (i.e. if you are a Premium or Sales Navigator Subscriber) or ask to be introduced to them via a common LinkedIn Connection. We could be lucky and our target prospect could have his/her contact information in a visible area of his LinkedIn Profile (this is suggested by the way), i.e. his/her email or work telephone number, which will make it easier for us to contact him/her.   Approaching them with the most effective message tailor made for each circumstance is vital at this point.

Maybe I am wrong but my understanding has been that LinkedIn is not just about connecting and networking but also about the opportunity it offers to generate new business.   LinkedIn actively promote this thought by offering subscription services such as LinkedIn Sales Navigator, aimed specifically at sales people with the aim of generating leads and business  With this in mind, what do you think is the best approach? Is it all about HOW you are approached? Is it all about how relevant or well crafted and researched the message is?   The way we work is changing so rapidly and what was great yesterday is not always so great today.

You need to help people to understand any tool, the context, the approaches, what works, what doesn't - sounds like an interesting cup of coffee very soon.  Today in London has been about helping a huge IT company, a luxury event and a management consultancy to contextualise LinkedIn properly and plan to move it forward incrementally towards revenue.  Interesting to see the clients reaction in one meeting when I encouraged them to not train everyone as they thought I would say that when I am much more aligned to slow, positive and reinforced learning and coaching as it simply translates into much more, much better and more more profitable LinkedIn use for clients and that for me is the key.

Interesting that one theme today has been the fear of putting 'stuff' out, of actually talking to people on LinkedIn and whilst I can completely understand the fear (Atelophobia for the record) everyone talks, but perhaps a better understanding of context, style and whom sees might help you?

1.07E+17,"After finishing another well attended edition of our social selling intro workshops, I was asked once again about how relevant Twitter is now in the B2B Space. My reply...   Twitter is a spent force when it comes to Social Selling. The platform has it’s uses for journalists, live events and of course Presidents, but for the average business owner or Marketing manager, there is no real ROI.    Why do I think This?  Fundamentally Twitter suffers because it has no filter, essentially it is the internet version of standing in a busy train station and shouting as loudly as you can about your product. It also lacks in depth prospecting tools which is crucial in the Social Selling process. For example, you are unable to access the wealth of information you can on Sales Navigator using Twitter's dashboard. The direct messaging (DM) feature is also better served on Instagram as the social media platform is no longer reserved for young people, in fact it has seen its biggest growth with the 45+ demographic over the last 18 months. If you want to prospect, get a decent account up and DM your buyers with links to some engaging content.

You also run the risk of receiving a lot of ""Ignore - I Don't Knows"" from prospective connections, which may result in LinkedIn banning you from sending further connection requests or restricting your account.

For a start it's revealing how few people in my network have posted anything in the past week - only about 275 or 5160 people I am connected with or follow have posted 1 or more updates - that's about 6%!   2. What is does mean is that I/we can see when the less active people we follow have posted something, if we check weekly. This is a massive prospecting opportunity! We can view their profile, see what they've posted and find a way to engage. So, by following prospects this gives us a way to detect when they are active. [What a useful hack for those who don't have Sales Navigator :-) ]  3. There is then a section listing all the company pages we follow. No real value here, except to unfollow those who are of no further interest.  4. Below Company Pages there's a section listing all the other people who have posted nothing in the last week.

1.08E+17,Soliciting on LinkedIn... I utilize LinkedIn as a sales tool regularly most sales professionals do.  I am also a business owner.  I accepted an invite from a fellow insurance professional on LinkedIn.  This professional proceeded to email me to offer their services.  I declined and said I was not interested .  He proceeded to tell me that I should not have accepted his invite if I wasn't interested.  He than proceeded to tell me that he was attempting to qualify my Agency for an opportunity and basically I lost out.  If that was the case; why wouldn't you lead with that in your initial email if you are trying to earn my business?  If I had approached one of the CEO’s or CFO’s in my LinkedIn group the way this Insurance Professional approached me; I would never earn their business.

(Note: in regular LinkedIn, if you set your profile to anonymous, then you can’t see who views your profile)  4) InMails – you can reach out to people who you do not know to start a conversation without having to send an invitation to connect  5) The advanced Inbox – Sales Navigator has a separate Inbox, which gives you a lot of ice-breakers and helpful information when you want to reach out to someone and the information flows seamlessly into many CRMs now.

This issue increased through grad school and now in the working world. This can be considered a ""customer"" pain point. I look for a way on this platform to take notes, update relationships status and more but I can't find this component.   It seems that you USED to have something like this but pulled it down to improve the user experience. You suggest to check out Recruiter Lite or Sales Navigator if I'm interested in some type of feature like this. I'm, however, not a recruiter or a sales professional. I'd love to simply connect and keep track to my connection.   Can you see about providing a personal networking CRM (type) feature?

It's just an example of LinkedIn's crappy search, which not only is inconvenient in tools like Sales Navigator but costs advertising money with poor targeting.   This is the digital version of “I know that half of my advertising dollars are wasted, I just don’t know which half.”  This particular result comes up if you search for CEOs in the Boston area in companies with 50-1000 employees.   One person is the real CEO.  One person is in the office of the CEO. (Okay, at least ""CEO"" was in their title at the company, so that’s understandable.)  And one person works at the company but is the CEO of another company with fewer than 10 employees.   It’s this third case which is especially annoying because it happens all the time.   It makes searches less useful, and it means that some of your ad spend on LinkedIn is wasted – maybe a lot of it.   LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft, which has some of the most sophisticated search technology in the world.

1.26E+17,"In a realm of often arbitrary and nonsensical employee titles, how does an SDR go about targeting the right demographics? From “Head Lead Champion” to “Special Engineering Specialist,” the decision of which individual deserves attention can be tricky, regardless of the amount of experience the prospector has.   While some titles lead to unavoidable wild-goose chases across Sales Navigator, others are more clear cut: we know what to do with “Director of Engineering,” “Chief Technology Officer,” and “QA Manager.” If properly categorized and mapped, the leads that give way to successful demos can paint a picture of the most effective contacts to reach out to. Not only does this improve the efficacy of our lead-selecting process and subsequent conversion to demos, it also saves us time that would be spent entertaining the wrong POCs.   Of the three main company areas that we search within, one of them generated 52% of successful leads; while, within the five titles prioritized in those areas, three of them served to make up 62% of successful demos. Essentially, this data has allowed us to hone in on our target demographics, trimming the bulk from three areas with five or more titles to one area with three titles, saving us time and improving our lead-to-demo conversion. ",209,3,22,96,227,2013,1,1036,Field Team,66,non-subscriber,2016,3,69,11.35,17.96,14.81,25

Digital agency is the keyword. And it looks like we have 6,409 results.  All the info you need is their name and website. And then use the add-ons we talked about previously to split the names and get the email addresses. And that's how easy it is.  You can have your VAs or yourself go through any of these lead lists and the only thing worth tweaking is coming up with the right searches to find the highest quality leads.

In order to receive this free trial, I had to input my credit card. NO charges would appear WITHOUT my knowledge or approval. Lies. Lies. Lies.  I never received a notification of any kind that my free trial period was coming to an end. I was notified by my credit card company about a possible fraudulent charge to my credit card. I have NEVER received a fraudulent notification before and had to investigate.  I found out from my credit card company that it was a MONTHLY charge for $88 from LinkedIn! I looked back at the congratulatory email I received from LinkedIn when I registered for Sales Navigator and read where there would be no unauthorized charges. Well, guess what, the moment I agreed to the trial, I agreed to be royally conned and ripped off by LinkedIn.  I attempted to cancel my subscription to Sales Navigator immediately. Guess what??

If the company page does not happen to carry that data by any chance, you can look up the number of profiles that are associated with that business, and assume that's the minimum number of employees for that business. However, the net result is to send 100 new connection requests, you have to go through 140 target profiles. :-)",106,7,4,43,227,1999,1,2290,not an lss subscriber,75,jss,2004,8,64,19.63,14.47,14.21,15.3

1.27E+17,"On LinkedIn, you start winning big when you are hard to forget. Remember that depth is far more valuable than width. In other words, the trust you have with your followers is far more valuable than the amount of followers you have. I rather have 100 people that live and breath my content than 2000 people who sort of like my content.   Here’s my 4 step framework to build real relationships and be memorable:  1) Get sales navigator free for 30 days. You can find it at the top right of your home screen where it says, “try premium for free”. In sales navigator, look for an ideal prospect in your ideal industry and send educational content to PEOPLE WITH THE SAME FIRST NAME. Don’t ask for anything in return. Save this group of people.   2) Once you get enough people accepting, make a selfie video thanking them for being in your network and mention them by name. Since you’ve connected with people with the same name, you can be personalized, yet scalable. Calling them works well too.   3) Send another educational piece of content mentioning their name again. Now you’re pulling at their heart strings??.   4) Ask for an appointment to talk about how you can help each other.   For more, follow Frank Aziz.

The DFW market is the 5th largest #salescity in the US.  DFW has over 474,000 sales roles.  (LinkedIn Sales Navigator)  2.  There are over 150,000 sales leadership roles in the DFW market.  A couple more observations:  1. Every year, we get calls from hundreds of companies who need a better source of sales talent.  They are adding headcount, replacing headcount, they are relocating to #dfwsalescity, etc.  2. Most companies have a sales training program, Some have a executive leadership program, but seldom do we see a Sales Manager  Development program.    3.  Our first sales alumni from 5 years ago are now moving into their first leadership positions and don't have the time for an MBA or Master's degree.  This past week, I had a great conversation with a Sales Enablement professional who had documented over a 100% increase in sales when they focused on Sales Management.

Some of the things included in the LinkedIn Sales Navigator update for Q2/2018 are:  Lead Pages: The new look to find new leads. This is WAY better than it was. Now when you find someone who is your ideal customer, you can scroll to the bottom of the profile and see other people like them at other companies, making it so 1 relationship can lead to a bunch of new business.  Improved Sales Navigator Inbox: A more manageable and useful inbox – Sales Navigator will look more like regular LinkedIn – which should be easier for you to use.  GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance coming soon – LinkedIn Sales Navigator will have full compliance – without you doing anything extra – starting in May 2018.  I recommend doing a full export of your profile and all connections ASAP just in case something strange happens to restrict your access to the contact information of the connections you’ve built. You never know what exactly will happen until it happens with LinkedIn, so I recommend you do this TODAY!  Need help?

Greg was able to get a CEO to attend a Sharks playoff hockey game with him, which led to an intro to the company's CIO and a closed deal.  Like Greg, the global advisory team at EY wanted to use the advanced search to pinpoint key targets. They identified people at an existing customer with blockchain and digital currency in their LinkedIn profiles, which expanded the relationship into a new area.

8.52E+16,"Here are my LinkedIn prospecting tips that landed me 2 clients:  1. On a daily basis, check who has viewed your profile and reach out to connect with them. Also, when you are sending out invites, always write a personalized message and don't just send out the generic one.  2. When you are first connecting, don't be salesy at all. Try to connect with people by referencing something interesting about their profile.   3. Before Sales Navigator, I was just maximizing my searches with the free account. The benefit of having a premium account is that you can do more refined searches of people.  5. After someone has connected with you, write back and say thank you. I say, ""Let me know if you need help professionally in any way or want to chat about Facebook ads."" I sometimes just ask them how their week went to start a conversation.  6. Send out helpful news, articles, etc. to people in your network and post updates regularly. LinkedIn is great because if one of your contacts likes your update, their network may possibly see your posts.  9. Overall, be authentic, helpful and non-salesy - that will take you far on LinkedIn. Comment on other people's posts to gain exposure and don't try to push yourself on other people.  Do you guys have other tips?

1.22E+17,"**If you use zoom calls or phone calls to get new clients then you are going to want to read this!**  This is how it works…  I create a buyer profile of a client that is most likely to buy from me.  My buyer profile consists of the:  - Industry my ideal client is in - The Geographical Location - The Title of their Position - and keywords that associate with what they do.  I then enter this information in Sales Navigator on LinkedIn and use a software to begin sending out customized scripts to connect with my target audience.  The message is written in a way that sets an appointment in my calendar for me on automation.  Once the appointment is set, I get on a zoom call with my new connection.  I follow my 7-Step closing process and find the best solution on how I can help them.  If it’s a big deal, I draft up an agreement, and if it’s an online course, I send them the payment link to check out.  I don’t have to worry about ad spend with this strategy, and I don’t have to talk to anyone who doesn’t already know who I am and what I do.  If you are in a business where you close sales through zoom calls or phone calls, feel free to ask questions.  If you can close a few more deals a month, it can make all of the difference.

7.27E+16,"Between the big funding announcement with SalesLoft and LinkedIn, some of the cool updates coming to Sales Navigator, and revamp of Microsoft's sales suite, it's going to an interesting next couple of years. I'm sensing a big battle between Salesforce and Microsoft. Can there be two players?  We're trying to get LeadIQ to be hub for all these tools to work in perfect harmony. Reps who spend more time selling vs. doing tedious task like data entry, guessing emails, and logging/looking up existing account activity are throwing away time. Research should always come first.  Another thing that is happening that is going to help people a ton is using more more media to sell. The days of just being a call center, or just sending cold emails out are dead. You have to be able to do all kinds of tactics to reach a prospecting.   Whether it's mail, email, face to face, calling, advertising, social selling, etc. You get the idea. It's like driving on the highway in rush hour if you only do one of these things.  Whatever the equation is, this blog post I wrote back in December fits the bill really well on why you are missing out if you aren't using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and I think it also speaks to why the investment in SalesLoft is a smart one.   https://lnkd.in/eg-b46g",222,7,15,4,227,2008,3,3473,not an lss subscriber,72,non-subscriber,2008,3,78,24,17.62,16.79,19.4

Over the years, I’ve gathered a network of 1000’s of connections organically without paying much attention.  I’ve never been much of a mindful, skilled “networker”– actively inviting people to connect.  Recently I went through each of my connections and segmented them with a tag. (You need Sales Navigator and time on your hands to do this).   Here’s the composition of my LI Network by size:  No 1 the largest segment are fellow brand strategists and consultants.  No 2 are  diverse group members in shared LI groups.  No.3 are creative professionals in various disciplines, but dominated by graphic designers.  No.4 are known clients/colleagues–people I’ve worked for/with.  No 5 are “influencers” people who don’t make decisions in my area of expertise but could make a referral in the future.  No 6 are “suspects” people I have specifically researched as potential clients and invited them to connect.  Influencers and suspects (those most critical to my business) are the smallest portion of my network.   Moral of the story:  Your LinkedIn network is a real and important business /career asset.

1.27E+17,"I want to share two concepts that I think could really help with your targeting. You first need the upgraded version of LinkedIn called Sales Navigator.  The concepts are:  1) Targeting people with iterative searches. In many cases, you can find people who aren’t normally being searched for by using synonyms in the keywords section that you normally would not use and that others are not using. For example, instead of typing  real estate agent, type estate specialist. This pulls up a group of people who are not being engaged with. You could very well be the first person to message them.   2) Targeting people who are LinkedIn virgins. In sales navigator, you can target people who just opened up a LinkedIn account yesterday. If you message those people, they likely have never gotten a message before, so they will be even more receptive than the normal person.   These tips are a specific nuance that can really help you get prospects attention.

Too many people on LinkedIn are ""addicted"" to posting attention grabbing content for the sake of likes/views/comments that are really doing very little for their professional brand or business.  Meanwhile, others are grinding, prospecting, cold calling, chasing leads, converting those to opportunities, and closing deals through both traditional sales techniques and social selling.  I'm personally using Sales Navigator as one of those tools and it's great!

9.32E+16,"FYI,  the industry category search with LinkedIn recruiter is based on individual profiles and the industries people select for their profiles.  This is only as accurate as the industries people select.  An example is a person goes into the staffing industry and selects staffing & recruiting as their industry but 2 years later leave to pursue a different career.  Many people forget to update the industry section of their profiles when changing careers.  Or, an accountant might select accounting as their industry but work for Microsoft which is a technology company.  With LinkedIn Sales Navigator, there are a few issues.  First, how does LinkedIn know what industry a company is in? Is the LinkedIn system looking at industry categories on individual profiles? Not sure how accurate that is when searching for companies in specific industries.  Another issue with Sales Navigator is if you search a city, then select an industry and also select number of employees there is a technical glitch.  The search pulls people from the industry but uses ""Global"" number of employees instead of number of employees in that city.

1.41E+17," MY Linkedin Prospecting Basics (some of you might get mad at me):  #1 - Sign up for a Linkedin Premium service - Sales Navigator - used for targeting and list building. Also, and this is just my opinion, I think they are more lenient on you if you are paying them when it comes to outreach.  #2 - Purchase an automation tool for sending out invites - Quite a few out there, I am currently using GPZ and Linkedin Helper, but getting ready to test out ""jetbuzz"".  #3 - Start at 20 invites and work your way up to 100, do this over 5 to 6 days. NEVER GO OVER 100! NEVER GO OVER 100!!! - Sending out too many too fast will get you in trouble and shut down.  #4 - ALWAYS use the person's name in the invite.  #5 - Keep your messaging super simple. Why? A. Sending long messages will draw the wrong kind of attention from Linkedin bots and people. B. People don't read long DM invite messages.  #6 - Know your audience. This plays a major role in how you structure your message and how to keep it simple.  #7 - Send a thank you message AND yes you can include your pitch, but keep it casual and nice. Some people automate this part, I actually like to manually do this. I may change that soon.

I use Google Assistant as well, but Cortana integrates with my Windows 10 PCs.  Stuff like Office, OneDrive (and photos to Google Drive for redundancy), and OneNote are all there as well as must haves like Office Lens, Swiftkey, LinkedIn and Sales Navigator, and To Do (the successor to Wunderlist).

This happens because they see your name on trusted media sites, their friends refer you, they see you on social media, etc. To get to this point, there is no trick. It's just quantity x quality, with a heavy dose of patience. In my experience, someone who is scaling high quality and genuine touches will not fail at new business development over time.   Here are some examples of touches I like to use: - Cold call a lot! - Write a handwritten card to 100 people in your target market asking for advice on your offering - Build a vertically targeted email list of 10,000 people using LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Email Hunter...ask if ""XYZ Pain / ABC Opportunity"" are relevant for them right now  - Leverage a graphic designer (ex. Katie Wohlwend) to design printed notecards for you that you can hand sign and address.

8.63E+16,"Sales Tip for Tuesday: I want to thank Justin Gurney for the shout the other day. Social Selling is a platform that allows you to engage with key decision makers in any industry.  And whether you use LinkedIn or Google to research the prospect and then use another tool to find their email address or you use Twitter to start engaging with them - the key is you get to engage directly with them.   There’s no middle person that is stopping you from getting to where you want to be.  But you need to know how to creatively prospect.  And I will say that I’ve never seen a tool that helps you do that better than LinkedIn Sales Navigator.  You’ll literally never run out of leads.  Greg Beckstrom or Stephanie Goodman, who both work at LinkedIn, can tell you more about the tool.  So if you’re going to commit to a Social Selling approach, go all in.

Even at a ""risk-averse"" company, EY embraced a modern approach head-on, rather than avoiding change management.  2) ""We wanted marketing to see the value of the platform and really help in getting the word out,"" so EY gave access to many marketing departments. Great example of what world-class sales and marketing alignment looks like.  3) ""There's a maintenance process that goes into relationship building and the sales triggers really help with that. You don’t just want to be there when it’s time to buy, you want to be there in between; building the credibility and confidence during the non-sales times.""  4) When her team would say: ""I already know everyone at my accounts,"" Danielle would ask: ""Didn’t they just acquire x company?

Here are a few areas where Microsoft has made an impact in this release, only available to Gartner clients:  *Dynamics 365 for Sales has revamped mobile and tablet capabilities, which is significant because mobility is a core need for sales force automation (SFA) solutions.   *Dynamics 365 for Sales provides Office 365 and LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration for syncing data between applications, thus differentiating itself in the market.   *The newly added sales productivity features in Dynamics 365 for Sales enhance the management of long B2B and B2C sales cycles.   *Dynamics 365 for Sales has an improved drag-and-drop business process flow designer within the visual process designer tool, which aims to optimize end-to-end sales processes and increase sales efficiency.",168,4,24,96,227,2009,1,503,not an lss subscriber,67,non-subscriber,2011,9,60,13.37,8.2,13.69,24.26
