"75679439034931713","Truly excited to see the market reaction to these upcoming releases. As an avid LinkedIn user since my early college days, it's been fun seeing LinkedIn grow from an online resume to its current state as a complete platform that sales organizations are building around in four major ways:  1) Deepening marketing and sales alignment. As a salesperson, have you ever felt like there isn't an easy way to enable marketing to target the leads and accounts you actually care about? That's solved by connecting Sales Navigator to LinkedIn Campaign manager.  2) Data centralization: Don't have a streamlined view of customer data across your various sales tools? Sales Navigator Application Platform integrates Sales Navigator across the Business Intelligence, Marketing Automation, eSignature, Web Conference, CRM and Sales Acceleration tools you already use.  3) Sales leader pipeline management and visibility: Wish you had a dashboard showing updated trigger events on your key deals, so you could coach your team and improve forecast accuracy? Check out Dealbook.  4) Sales Ops & sales teams: Do you spend time, energy and resources on improving CRM data accuracy? LinkedIn will now help notify you when someone's actual role differs from what's in your CRM.  https://lnkd.in/gn4uxhb","197","Senior","Unknown","Tech & Media","North America","Male","3711","75","1-10","76"

Interesting that one theme today has been the fear of putting 'stuff' out, of actually talking to people on LinkedIn and whilst I can completely understand the fear (Atelophobia for the record) everyone talks, but perhaps a better understanding of context, style and whom sees might help you? It is  bit like talking to your friends on a train about what you're up to at work. After all if you don't tell people what you're doing who will?

"130743578575059205","How do you use LinkedIn?  1) To connect with people you know (or at least have interacted with) in real life 2) To learn and stay up to date by following people and reading their postings (this includes browsing the front page with all content) 3) As a sales and marketing tool for which you use the search and outreach capabilities (hint: this is only fully useful with Sales Navigator, which is expensive though) 4) To assist you in your next career move 5) To do well at your current job (show people what you do and what you are looking for, make it easier for others to help you) 6) Thought leadership / personal brand building by sharing insights and perspectives and being a curator for the benefit of your network  #6 is a big thing for me. This works well.   #2 – the learning part – is also a key reason for me using LinkedIn. I get lots of good insights and inspiration through my network on LinkedIn today.   I have a Sales Navigator subscription, but I could definitely do a better job getting value out of it.   Building my network/virtual rolodex used to be the main reason for using Linkedin, but today this just happens as a natural part of my interactions.   What can you share?

But it's also QUALITY because of the caliber of guests that we feature on the show.  I'm not a genius when it comes to B2B marketing (the focus of our show).   But I know how to find the geniuses...and I know how to get them on our podcast.  Here are the 4 tools that fuel our guest outreach process:  1) LinkedIn Sales Navigator   If you're not already using this, you're missing out big time.  2) Hunter (dot io)  This lets me find email addresses for pretty much anyone. So long as I know their company's website, I'm set.  3) Mailshake  This is hands down the most important tool in our outreach stack.  It allows us to send guest outreach at scale, and it send the emails directly from our Google email accounts.  4) Calendly  There are lots of scheduling tools, but I haven't found one that's cleaner and easier to use than this one.  #HowToPodcast  -----  Click the link in the first comment for the 26-part process that will show you how to start a podcast from start to finish.

"127098376827178788","I just reached 10,000 connections! It took a while but let me explain what I did.   Here are a few tips to help you get that many connections.   1) Upgrade to Sales Navigator. You can search more people and Linkedin is more lenient with those that pay for their platform.   2) Join groups with your target market and start conversations. When other people comment on your discussion in a group and the group has a lot of engagement, many people will see it. Those people will click on your profile and likely want to connect.   3) Use an automated software to share content with your target market. When you search people, you can auto connect with a lot of your prospects and share valuable content. Be sure not to spam and make sure you are not connecting with more then 100 people a day.   4) Write content using status updates and articles. When people like and share your artilces or status updates, all their connections will see it. Those connections will likely reach out to you.   There is more... But use those for now and you will do  great. ","189","Owner","Business Development","Prof Services","North America","Male","19284","74","1-10","79"

"79252985584277610","This is a very good thing the #LinkedInSalesSolutions team does: they show actual PROOF that Sales Navigator can produce trackable/traceable profit, increase revenue and the likes.  Just as few personal note after reading the blog, mostly things I don't quite agree with but I invite you to read the article first and then come back to this post and re-read the following:  1. Industry DOES determine success rates when reaching out to potential buyers, as much as market type/size. Sales Navigator will not produce the same results in all industries.  2. B2C is possible through Sales Navigator. Banking and Insurance are both very good proof of it. The question is: how scalable is it?  3. The uplift in the win rates mentioned in the blog seem to be a direct impact of using sales navigator...but it is very hard to actually prove that that only happens to reps just because they use SN.   As a quick wrap-up note: I love this kind of content. It shows that LinkedIn is learning at the same pace we all are. Social Selling / Digital Sales is way more than just one or 2 solutions.

So I keep progressing despite the cold shoulder. Tired of wasting energy as I'm growing older. But for the few people reading, thanks yo, you're awesome. And help me keep my head up often.  For the admins, moderators, and censors here. Maybe I'm wrong. You do pretend to hear complaints. Making a place that's only safe for certain opinions or thoughts about the state of business or industry within all this change. This is just a recruiting tool anyway.  Sales Navigator is a joke, the ad platform sucks. Doesn't matter since Microsoft bought it up. Data mining. Yeah we know what's up. At this point it always feels like luck.

"90009577706570934","Sales Navigator Updates  LinkedIn just released a major update to LinkedIn Sales Navigator to make it even more useful and profitable.  Some of the things included in the LinkedIn Sales Navigator update for Q2/2018 are:  Lead Pages: The new look to find new leads. This is WAY better than it was. Now when you find someone who is your ideal customer, you can scroll to the bottom of the profile and see other people like them at other companies, making it so 1 relationship can lead to a bunch of new business.  Improved Sales Navigator Inbox: A more manageable and useful inbox – Sales Navigator will look more like regular LinkedIn – which should be easier for you to use.  GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance coming soon – LinkedIn Sales Navigator will have full compliance – without you doing anything extra – starting in May 2018.  I recommend doing a full export of your profile and all connections ASAP just in case something strange happens to restrict your access to the contact information of the connections you’ve built. You never know what exactly will happen until it happens with LinkedIn, so I recommend you do this TODAY!  Need help?

I was wasting time and money and making no sales.  I needed to make a change and focus on identifying and building relationships with a highly targeted list.  So I created a process that started with understanding my buyer persona.   I used LinkedIn Sales Navigator (LSN) along with Hunter.io to establish a personal lead list comprised of key decision makers and influencers, who were within my first degree LinkedIn network connections.  I then created a personalized email that would resonate with and engage each intended contact.  Soon, my response rate grew and I was closing BIGGER deals FASTER.  I was substantially improving my return on investment and had more hours in the day for high-values activities.   Everyone can improve their marketing campaign by leveraging technology tools and making each contact more personal.","156","Senior","Sales","Tech & Media","North America","Male","5782","67","1-10","0"

"141404162231506128"," MY Linkedin Prospecting Basics (some of you might get mad at me):  #1 - Sign up for a Linkedin Premium service - Sales Navigator - used for targeting and list building. Also, and this is just my opinion, I think they are more lenient on you if you are paying them when it comes to outreach.  #2 - Purchase an automation tool for sending out invites - Quite a few out there, I am currently using GPZ and Linkedin Helper, but getting ready to test out ""jetbuzz"".  #3 - Start at 20 invites and work your way up to 100, do this over 5 to 6 days. NEVER GO OVER 100! NEVER GO OVER 100!!! - Sending out too many too fast will get you in trouble and shut down.  #4 - ALWAYS use the person's name in the invite.  #5 - Keep your messaging super simple. Why? A. Sending long messages will draw the wrong kind of attention from Linkedin bots and people. B. People don't read long DM invite messages.  #6 - Know your audience.

Recent media interest is amusing to us because we’ve been documenting each generation of Facebook Ads political extremism (2009) and other radical psychochgraphic targeting for years.  Linked in has similar extremist-targeting problems on the advertising side (LinkedIn Ads) and in human search (Sales Navigator).

You can see who's opening each piece of content you curate for them and see how much time they spend doing it. We've been using it for multi-touch campaigns and also for internal communications. It's even replaced our new hire checklist in some divisions. Every time a new rep joins I'll just send them the PD link with the materials they need to go through on their first couple of weeks.

If you have a big client you're targeting, or an upcoming pitch with a big company, and they're on LinkedIn, invest in this app! It doesn't deliver short term, but trust me, if you do, you'll enter their office knowing everything about their business and where exactly you can help it grow!

So, if you are targeting profiles with a certain number of employees, make sure you reverify by checking the respective company page. If the company page does not happen to carry that data by any chance, you can look up the number of profiles that are associated with that business, and assume that's the minimum number of employees for that business. However, the net result is to send 100 new connection requests, you have to go through 140 target profiles. :-)","106","VP","Business Development","Finance & Ins.","North America","Male","2298","75","5001-10000","64"

Check it out: ourworldindata.org  Denmark has about 5.7 million inhabitants ( World Bank and Google)  Latest data from my Sales Navigator account suggests  2.1 million LinkedIn accounts just in #Denmark.  Even more important, about 70% of the Danish LinkedIn accounts are used regularly ( at least once a week or +).  My take if you're trying to find a new job ( whether you are from Dk or not)  ""Become visible and valuable"" Jill Rowley I started by sharing content about Brazil. Find your field of expertise, publish and share relevant content. Learn about other people's interests. “Your network is your net-worth” Porter Gale. Make sure you get in touch with your connections once in awhile. Not to pitch them, not to sell them, but to connect with them at a deeper level.   Help: Countless times on my LinkedIn feed I can see ""Help Signals"". Helping others out has enabled me to connect, start conversations and open up doors that I'd never imagined.  Do the Unexpected: I'm baffled by the sheer number of people who still follow rather than lead. Create a unique approach that can make your personality stand out. I like sending out videos or handwritten cards. What do you do?  Be Humorous: It helps :)","220","Senior","Community and Social Services","Prof Services","Europe","Male","7443","73","1-10","82"

If you are NOT maximising your use of the free version, then paying LinkedIn some cash will not improve things. However, if you are actively and strategically utilising LinkedIn then an upgrade can be brilliant. I use Premium and Sales Navigator.  LinkedIn has just announced a new Q2 release of its £60/month option, which will include:   - Find the information you need on the people you care about with new Lead Pages   - Understand who to target inside an account, and how to engage those key decision makers   - Manage messages easily within the Sales Navigator inbox  If you'd like a chat to establish if an upgrade might be beneficial to you... :)  You should be able to easily find the relevant information you need about the people and companies that matter to you and know how to build a strategy to engage with them.

Seasoned LinkedIn pros will know what I'm talking about: Sales Navigator.   If the newsfeed is the flashy singer getting all the attention, sales navigator is the savvy manager making all the decisions.  It may not get the exposure of your content, but sales navigator is incredibly powerful. There's nowhere else on the web where you can connect to almost any professional in real time, under one roof.  There's more than enough players to choose from too with over 550 million registered users which is growing by 2 new users joining every SECOND, and shows no signs of slowing.   I think sales navigator plays a huge part in LinkedIn's growth. You may not see it, but many people are using it daily to get leads for their business. We certainly do at Web Traffic That Works for our own lead generation and for all of our clients .  Let's shed some light on how to use it effectively.

"74872726623595647","Yesterday's New York LinkedIn meetup was awesome. Connected with some people leading the platform's growth like Daniel, Colin and Manu. 3 LinkedIn insights from it below:  1) Treat your local connections carefully  When sorting through connection requests, pay extra attention to people based in your city. Is there any way you can collaborate? Local networks are key.  2) LinkedIn's back-end (sales navigator etc) is powerful  Sales navigator's ability to target almost anyone in granular detail is, as of right now, totally unmatched. No other social platform offers it, making it an unfair advantage for many sales teams.  3) Right now, LinkedIn is red hot  If you're not spending most of your social media time on LinkedIn, you should be. Everyone was in agreement that there's nowhere else better to build your brand and spread your message than right here.   This last point confirmed what I'd also seen - LinkedIn has been growing massively recently, and it's showing no signs of slowing.   Great way to end my first day working in NYC.

"88697690852382142","Don't forget to frequently utilize the powerful Search Engine of LinkedIn to zero in on your target prospects. You can search by location, current company, past company, industry, keywords etc. You can even search inside the connections of a 1st connection of yours (should they allow their 1st connections to view their connections).   What to do next?   Visit their profiles and identify if you wish to further communicate with them!   If you do, you could for example send them a customized invitation to connect, an Inmail (i.e. if you are a Premium or Sales Navigator Subscriber) or ask to be introduced to them via a common LinkedIn Connection. We could be lucky and our target prospect could have his/her contact information in a visible area of his LinkedIn Profile (this is suggested by the way), i.e. his/her email or work telephone number, which will make it easier for us to contact him/her.   Approaching them with the most effective message tailor made for each circumstance is vital at this point.

"127098376827178788","I want to share two concepts that I think could really help with your targeting. You first need the upgraded version of LinkedIn called Sales Navigator.  The concepts are:  1) Targeting people with iterative searches. In many cases, you can find people who aren’t normally being searched for by using synonyms in the keywords section that you normally would not use and that others are not using. For example, instead of typing  real estate agent, type estate specialist. This pulls up a group of people who are not being engaged with. You could very well be the first person to message them.   2) Targeting people who are LinkedIn virgins. In sales navigator, you can target people who just opened up a LinkedIn account yesterday. If you message those people, they likely have never gotten a message before, so they will be even more receptive than the normal person.   These tips are a specific nuance that can really help you get prospects attention.

For example, instead of typing  real estate agent, type estate specialist. This pulls up a group of people who are not being engaged with. You could very well be the first person to message them.   2) Targeting people who are LinkedIn virgins. In sales navigator, you can target people who just opened up a LinkedIn account yesterday. If you message those people, they likely have never gotten a message before, so they will be even more receptive than the normal person.   These tips are a specific nuance that can really help you get prospects attention.

"142140665796112338","The only magic bullet that I've seen in prospecting is brand. Meaning - as you build a reputation for yourself, people will begin to frequently reach out to you to become clients. This happens because they see your name on trusted media sites, their friends refer you, they see you on social media, etc. To get to this point, there is no trick. It's just quantity x quality, with a heavy dose of patience. In my experience, someone who is scaling high quality and genuine touches will not fail at new business development over time.   Here are some examples of touches I like to use: - Cold call a lot! - Write a handwritten card to 100 people in your target market asking for advice on your offering - Build a vertically targeted email list of 10,000 people using LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Email Hunter...ask if ""XYZ Pain / ABC Opportunity"" are relevant for them right now  - Leverage a graphic designer (ex. Katie Wohlwend) to design printed notecards for you that you can hand sign and address. Send 1,000 of these to your target market, and follow up with a calendar invite asking for a time to speak (if you want me to send you the tool I built for this, just message me)  - Record a personal video for 50 prospects, send a private YouTube link in a LinkedIn connection request  #happyhunting","233","CXO","Business Development","Prof Services","North America","Male","3278","68","1-10","73"

To give you an analogy you have given everyone a top of the range carbon fibre racing bike whilst they are all pushing a happy shopper not realising it is actually a bicycle and they can pedal it to move forward faster, a lot faster :/ Then told them all to go win the Tour d'France without teaching or showing them how to ride or pedal.  You need to help people to understand any tool, the context, the approaches, what works, what doesn't - sounds like an interesting cup of coffee very soon.  Today in London has been about helping a huge IT company, a luxury event and a management consultancy to contextualise LinkedIn properly and plan to move it forward incrementally towards revenue.  Interesting to see the clients reaction in one meeting when I encouraged them to not train everyone as they thought I would say that when I am much more aligned to slow, positive and reinforced learning and coaching as it simply translates into much more, much better and more more profitable LinkedIn use for clients and that for me is the key.

"95374579390170440","LinkedIn has been making a lot of improvements to the experience of being on LinkedIn lately.  But one thing I still haven't seen a lot of value or changes on are Skill Endorsements on our profiles.  I have a lot of them on my profile, and see many on other people's profiles and I've come to realize that you really have to manage them to keep them accurate. Sometimes new skills get added that aren't even relevant to what you do that need to be removed, i'm not even sure how that happens.  Since we know that endorsements can just be added, and people can endorse us for skills that we may or may not have, as well as endorse us when they don't even really know if we have the skill, where is the real value then of the feature?  I've read that recruiters don't trust or use them for that reason, sales professionals don't use them for prospects (they're not even searchable in Sales Navigator) and since they are at the bottom of your profile, there is a good chance most people may never see them.   With this being the case, you might think that LinkedIn could enhance them to actually be valuable or just remove them altogether.  Has anyone seen where endorsements have provided them value?   What would you do to improve them to make them valuable if you were LinkedIn?  #justjohn","235","CXO","Business Development","Prof Services","North America","Male","3259","69","myself only","80"
"101588648618800665","Since the launch of the new LinkedIn user interface, users have lamented that Advanced Search is gone, it only exists in Sales Navigator now, and you have to pay for it. However, you can still do advanced searches on LinkedIn. They are just more integrated into the regular search functionality.

"101588648618800665","If you are considering Sales Navigator on LinkedIn, here are 5 reasons why I use it: 1) No limit on the number of searches you can run in a month  2) The search capabilities are good on regular LinkedIn, but hyper-mega-targeted with Sales Navigator  3) You can search anonymously and still see who has viewed your profile – for me, I typically look at someone’s profile a few times before I reach out, and when anonymous, I don’t appear to be stalking them. (Note: in regular LinkedIn, if you set your profile to anonymous, then you can’t see who views your profile)  4) InMails – you can reach out to people who you do not know to start a conversation without having to send an invitation to connect  5) The advanced Inbox – Sales Navigator has a separate Inbox, which gives you a lot of ice-breakers and helpful information when you want to reach out to someone and the information flows seamlessly into many CRMs now.

"108903247384921447","SALES NAVIGATOR GETS A MAKE OVER  Just watched this video from Brynne Tillman about a new redesign for Sales Navigator ( https://lnkd.in/dJwJmXP  ) Sales Navigator was beginning to look pretty dated so it's good to see LinkedIn is actively working on bringing it up to date. The bulk of the new design remains the same, obvious changes include a simpler menu bar and the addition of the standard LinkedIn Work Icon Grid giving access to other LinkedIn products such as groups,  advertising etc.  LinkedIn has also now incorporated Pointdrive a presentation application as a free addition for Sales Navigator Team users (generally used by Corporate sales team). There is better integration with CRM - which will again largely be of benefit to bigger companies  usings of Sales Force, MS Dynamics etc.  These users will be pleased with closer CRM integration especially the ability to save data back to the CRM system.  Clearly, the development of Sales Navigator is  driven by a focus on the needs of larger businesses,  smaller businesses will also benefit from  its continuing development.  If you are a small to medium sized business wondering about Sales Navigator you might find this article useful  ( https://goo.gl/JHtHdd  ):   Thanks to  Steve Phillip for alerting me to Brynne's video.","209","Senior","Media and Communication","Prof Services","Europe","Male","4729","80","1-10","83"

"133104929823634447","FINALLY ... LinkedIn Sales Navigator is coming of age.   #SalesNavigator has evolved from an extension of #LinkedIn into a separate product. More than 80% of the Forbes Cloud 100 use Sales Navigator in their Sales process.  #SalesNav traditionally had a Startup offering vibe to it. There was little clarity on launch cycles, road-map of development, pre-release training etc. It also merely integrated a couple of systems, instead of working seamlessly with dozens of #SalesTech apps that Sales Reps use.  This is all about to change!  LinkedIn has announced that here forward, Sales Navigator updates will be issued on a quarterly cycle to provide advanced communications and training for administrators and users so they have adequate time to familiarise themselves with new features and leverage them.

Too many people on LinkedIn are ""addicted"" to posting attention grabbing content for the sake of likes/views/comments that are really doing very little for their professional brand or business.  Meanwhile, others are grinding, prospecting, cold calling, chasing leads, converting those to opportunities, and closing deals through both traditional sales techniques and social selling.  I'm personally using Sales Navigator as one of those tools and it's great!

In May I started my role with Livingstone International Australia with no experience across the healthcare & consumable market and with no expectations on where this role could take me. I have since turned this role into my career,being able to actively prospect & introduce our products to companies daily . I have been blessed with opportunities to present our products to global companies,market leaders & even been able to consolidate businesses with our product range. In June I was first introduced to LinkedIn through Anthony Magro & Livingstone International Australia  providing its staff with the Sales Navigator Tool. Since that day I created a profile on LinkedIn where I started with  0 Connections to now having over 2000 Connections. I had a SSI score of 0 which is now 70 which includes being in the top 1% across my industry. I have been able to communicate with people all over the world but most of all build sustainable relationships with them.

"86290549238437340","Sales Tip for Tuesday: I want to thank Justin Gurney for the shout the other day. Social Selling is a platform that allows you to engage with key decision makers in any industry.  And whether you use LinkedIn or Google to research the prospect and then use another tool to find their email address or you use Twitter to start engaging with them - the key is you get to engage directly with them.   There’s no middle person that is stopping you from getting to where you want to be.  But you need to know how to creatively prospect.  And I will say that I’ve never seen a tool that helps you do that better than LinkedIn Sales Navigator.  You’ll literally never run out of leads.  Greg Beckstrom or Stephanie Goodman, who both work at LinkedIn, can tell you more about the tool.  So if you’re going to commit to a Social Selling approach, go all in.  And by all in - I mean 100 new contacts every day.  It sounds like a lot - but the results will follow.","180","Senior","Business Development","Tech & Media","North America","Male","7748","66","201-500","83"

"85078095035123445","Work Better Together with Sales Navigator - For B2B sales professionals, closing deals has never been harder.

Through the Microsoft Relationship Sales application, LinkedIn Sales Navigator integrates with Dynamics 365/CRM.

Without the Sales Navigator membership, it is impossible to get over 90 I believe.    ""Sales Navigator can boost your Social Selling Index by 20%"" - according to LinkedIn.  Check Your SSI: https://lnkd.in/bEH3sHR  Mine fluctuates in the 80s.  This week it is down a few points.  What the SSI does though is remind you of what you can be doing better to build better relationships.  But don't get too hung up on the number. I had a client who had a benchmark of the number  of coffees he had with prospective clients each week.  This week I have had some great face to face conversations, virtual meetings, group training sessions, and phone calls.  The SSI or my Klout score can't measure those things.

"72701558480791293","Between the big funding announcement with SalesLoft and LinkedIn, some of the cool updates coming to Sales Navigator, and revamp of Microsoft's sales suite, it's going to an interesting next couple of years. I'm sensing a big battle between Salesforce and Microsoft. Can there be two players?  We're trying to get LeadIQ to be hub for all these tools to work in perfect harmony. Reps who spend more time selling vs. doing tedious task like data entry, guessing emails, and logging/looking up existing account activity are throwing away time. Research should always come first.  Another thing that is happening that is going to help people a ton is using more more media to sell. The days of just being a call center, or just sending cold emails out are dead. You have to be able to do all kinds of tactics to reach a prospecting.   Whether it's mail, email, face to face, calling, advertising, social selling, etc. You get the idea. It's like driving on the highway in rush hour if you only do one of these things.  Whatever the equation is, this blog post I wrote back in December fits the bill really well on why you are missing out if you aren't using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and I think it also speaks to why the investment in SalesLoft is a smart one.   https://lnkd.in/eg-b46g","222","VP","Marketing","Tech & Media","North America","Either","3603","72","11-50","0"

"123265278705690185","1. Cold calling is no longer effective. Digital lead generation strategies provide far better results, while also consuming less time and energy.  2. Always Be Connecting. A mindset that drives you to continually seek out and welcome new connections will greatly assist your efforts in facilitating lead generation. Dedicate your free time to expanding your network, and remember that even someone who doesn’t profile as a prospective customer can be valuable to know.  3. Seek out qualified buyers. This doesn’t mean unleashing a barrage of unsolicited outreach, but rather taking subtle steps to get in front of potential prospects. Liking social media posts, joining LinkedIn groups, and utilizing prospecting tools like Sales Navigator are among the best ways to do so.","121","Owner","Business Development","Unknown","North America","Either","96","69","unknown","0"

Murphy, becomes the second student ever to lead #utdsales.  Mirra Gutman did so several times in 2017.  I'm always proud of our students when they show their skills and competitive nature by using LinkedIn appropriately.

"108547666057488026","Why do we teach social selling at #utdsales?  I'd like to propose that while social selling was the cutting edge a few years ago, it is now just table stakes in an omni channel strategy for engaging your customers in the b2b market place today.  Do you agree Mario M. Martinez Jr., Jamie Shanks, and Kurt Shaver?  It is our view that all our graduates will need to be social selling capable to complete in the current world of sales.  Thus we do use a SSI as a proxy for social selling mastery in our program.  Our students, at all levels of our program, should know their score and are taught how to use Sales Navigator.   We are working to develop modules to discuss social network theory and how essential it is to develop and provide value to your professional network to be effective in today's marketplace.   ON Friday of this week, we will recognize our student who have achieved social selling competency as well as award the top 5 social seller in Boot camp.  Congrats to Jordan T. Murphy, Ali Khan, Camille Buensuceso, and Ana-Maria Frampton for being on top of the leaderboard for our program  We appreciate the continued support from the Sales Solutions Team at LinkedIn (Garnor Morantes Justin Shriber, and Jonathan Lister).","214","Owner","Business Development","Gov/Edu/Non-P","North America","Either","6512","74","501-1000","0"
"108547666057488026","A few fun facts to start your day today.    1. The DFW market is the 5th largest #salescity in the US.  DFW has over 474,000 sales roles.  (LinkedIn Sales Navigator)  2.  There are over 150,000 sales leadership roles in the DFW market.  A couple more observations:  1. Every year, we get calls from hundreds of companies who need a better source of sales talent.  They are adding headcount, replacing headcount, they are relocating to #dfwsalescity, etc.  2. Most companies have a sales training program, Some have a executive leadership program, but seldom do we see a Sales Manager  Development program.    3.  Our first sales alumni from 5 years ago are now moving into their first leadership positions and don't have the time for an MBA or Master's degree.  This past week, I had a great conversation with a Sales Enablement professional who had documented over a 100% increase in sales when they focused on Sales Management.  What is our solution at #utdsales?  Starting on May 2nd,   We will initiate the Sales Leadership Summit to bridge the gap in Sales Leadership Development.    In one day we will have Jason Jordan, Dr. Leff Bonney, Rob Jeppsen, Dr. Howard Dover, and Lori Richardson.    This will be our inaugural event to help train the current and future sales leaders in our market.","221","Owner","Business Development","Gov/Edu/Non-P","North America","Either","6512","74","501-1000","0"

SN is epic by itself allowing you to create target lists, generates leads daily,  target people who have changed jobs, been in the news, actually posted as well as those following your company page within this saved search criteria.   PD takes social selling to the next level.  PD allows you to upload up to 10 presentations, videos, PDFs,  infographics, photos, white papers, whatever you want a potential client to see.  You can then include the PD link from this marketing content in your sales message on SN and elsewhere (e.g. I use it in my email signature).   You can then track who has accessed the content and downloaded it and LinkedIn tells you by email, (see graphic of me viewing my own content to demonstrate).  You can then see on PD how much of the deck someone has viewed for how long and who they are. You can then engage with that person knowing that they are interested in your content.  Often I find people who have not replied to an inmail do look at my PD and then engage and start talking to us about their LinkedIn marketing needs and how they can also use PD to drive leads for their company.   Classic #SocialSelling.

"119973088388752773","The power of LinkedIn is not solely in your 1st connections, it's also in your 2nd and 3rd connections. But only if you must have powerful, influential and well connected 1st connections in your industry and amongst your peers.  I have 10,300 1st Singaporean connections which leads me to being able to reach 2 million connections in Singapore through my 2nd and 3rd connections. There are 2.3m professionals on LinkedIn in Singapore, virtually everyone who is a white collar worker.   I can therefore reach 87% of everyone Singapore who is on LinkedIn.   As my late Grandad always told me, it's who you know not what you know. The power of the network is through your 1st connections.  When it comes to using Sales Navigator this is especially true. You need more 1st to be able to reach more 2nd and 3rd, but the right kind of 1st.   Saying yes more times than saying no will help you expand your network but check if the people you connect with have many shared connections with you, are in similar industries or are your peers and have a complete LinkedIn profile.  If you only have a few connections then you will only have a few 2nd connections and Sales Navigator simply will not work for you, especially if you also have an incomplete and out of date profile.   ","224","Director","Legal","Tech & Media","Asia","Either","29878","99","51-200","88"

At my StartUp Grind event in Hong Kong on Wednesday I was constantly asked about what Sales Navigator was and how it differed from the other LinkedIn Premium services. Here is my answer on video from the event.  As LinkedIn don't explain this very well and keep selling LinkedIn Premium to people who actually need and want Sales Navigator or tell people that they can use Recruiter for sales when in fact Sales Navigator is far superior, it's not surprising that I get asked this question at every talk I do about LinkedIn.  Ideally LinkedIn should just remove LinkedIn Premium as the functionality as I explain in the Q&A is terrible compared to SN.

His professionalism and efficiency as a salesperson inspires me. One of the things he mentioned was that if he notices a successful sales person, he would go to them, ask how they are currently achieving success, and implement the same techniques. Not all techniques will work for the same person but often times you’ll find something that works for you in the process. Well, Brian - I’ll be taking all the wonderful techniques you shared and use them throughout the second half of this semester!

If you were a Rapportive user (the product that LinkedIn acquired in 2012), Rapportive will be automatically be updated to Sales Navigator Lite over the coming weeks.

Two lessons here; 1) chat is frequently inferior to voice, and 2) Sales Navigator's Geography search filter doesn't behave as you would expect. I experienced what frustrates many chat customers - an agent who's not closely paying attention to the question being asked. Perhaps this agent is working too many concurrent chats?  LI-Agent: Hi Terry, Thank You for Contacting LinkedIn Enterprise Services. Me: Hello LI-Agent.. Me: As a result of a lead search, the search panel on the left side is showing strange results Me: Under Geography, it shows ""Greater Denver Area (117)"" and ""Colorado (107)"". How can Colorado have fewer leads than the greater Denver area? Me: The state level results should be greater than or equal to the metro area LI-Agent: I'm sorry for that issue. This is all related to how a person enters their geography within their own LinkedIn profile. LI-Agent: They have options on how to appear. Me: How does my sales preference for geography affect the search results? Me: I do have ""Colorado, US"" set up as one of my preferred geographies  ","197","Senior","Sales","Tech & Media","North America","Either","2190","66","11-50","78"

While it has been a nice experience overall, many of the Sales Navigator features aren't necessary for where I am at.  I wasn't sure on the process to downgrade and switch between plans, so I emailed their support.  Within 24 hours, I had a tech support reply with suggestions, ideas and an offer to refund the present month.  A few more emails back and forth (all with replies within minutes) they answered some of my questions, concerns and then once I was ready cancelled my SN plan and asked me to re-subscribe to another plan once ready.

Listen to this podcast where Rob Shore talks to Dan Swift (see short bio below) to discuss a very successful wholesaler case study where a wholesaling company:  *   generated over 400% return on investment within the first 10 months.  * held more than 250 meetings in 3 months, with over 500 investment      advisors where training was provided on how LinkedIn could be used within the financial services industry.  * positioned itself as an innovative leader in the financial services industry and positioned their wholesalers as sought-after experts.  In 2012 LinkedIn recruited Dan as a member of the senior leadership team to hire, train, and lead the Sales Solutions division at LinkedIn and bring LinkedIn Sales Navigator to market. He then launched LinkedIn Sales Navigator for Financial Services, Insurance and Banking. During his tenure, he created the LinkedIn profile optimization program ‘Resume to Reputation’.

Did you even know LinkedIn has a SOCIAL SELLING INDEX (SSI)??    I've been on LinkedIn since 2010 and only recently found out about this!  @Melonie Dodaro has a great article breaking it all down, I'll leave a link in the comments.  By checking out your SSI, you'll see how you stack up against your industry peers and your network on LinkedIn. Further, you can see how you are performing on each of the four elements of social selling -- establishing your professional brand, finding the right people, engaging with insights, and building relationships -- and track your progress over time to help you understand how you're improving.  Check out your social selling index score here: https://lnkd.in/f_JKb33  Comment with your own SSI score, and what you think you can do to increase it!  I've always focused on establishing my brand, and interacting with comments.  I'm at a disadvantage to people with Sales Navigator etc when it comes to finding the right people to connect with.

"122358487375285770","**If you use zoom calls or phone calls to get new clients then you are going to want to read this!**  This is how it works…  I create a buyer profile of a client that is most likely to buy from me.  My buyer profile consists of the:  - Industry my ideal client is in - The Geographical Location - The Title of their Position - and keywords that associate with what they do.  I then enter this information in Sales Navigator on LinkedIn and use a software to begin sending out customized scripts to connect with my target audience.  The message is written in a way that sets an appointment in my calendar for me on automation.  Once the appointment is set, I get on a zoom call with my new connection.  I follow my 7-Step closing process and find the best solution on how I can help them.  If it’s a big deal, I draft up an agreement, and if it’s an online course, I send them the payment link to check out.  I don’t have to worry about ad spend with this strategy, and I don’t have to talk to anyone who doesn’t already know who I am and what I do.  If you are in a business where you close sales through zoom calls or phone calls, feel free to ask questions.  If you can close a few more deals a month, it can make all of the difference.

"141404162231506128"," MY Linkedin Prospecting Basics (some of you might get mad at me):  #1 - Sign up for a Linkedin Premium service - Sales Navigator - used for targeting and list building. Also, and this is just my opinion, I think they are more lenient on you if you are paying them when it comes to outreach.  #2 - Purchase an automation tool for sending out invites - Quite a few out there, I am currently using GPZ and Linkedin Helper, but getting ready to test out ""jetbuzz"".  #3 - Start at 20 invites and work your way up to 100, do this over 5 to 6 days. NEVER GO OVER 100! NEVER GO OVER 100!!! - Sending out too many too fast will get you in trouble and shut down.  #4 - ALWAYS use the person's name in the invite.  #5 - Keep your messaging super simple. Why? A. Sending long messages will draw the wrong kind of attention from Linkedin bots and people. B. People don't read long DM invite messages.  #6 - Know your audience. This plays a major role in how you structure your message and how to keep it simple.  #7 - Send a thank you message AND yes you can include your pitch, but keep it casual and nice. Some people automate this part, I actually like to manually do this. I may change that soon.  Hope this helps :). #sales #linkedin #automation #howto #basic ","236","CXO","Business Development","Unknown","North America","Male","9133","57","unknown","71"

In order to receive this free trial, I had to input my credit card. NO charges would appear WITHOUT my knowledge or approval. Lies. Lies. Lies.  I never received a notification of any kind that my free trial period was coming to an end. I was notified by my credit card company about a possible fraudulent charge to my credit card. I have NEVER received a fraudulent notification before and had to investigate.  I found out from my credit card company that it was a MONTHLY charge for $88 from LinkedIn! I looked back at the congratulatory email I received from LinkedIn when I registered for Sales Navigator and read where there would be no unauthorized charges. Well, guess what, the moment I agreed to the trial, I agreed to be royally conned and ripped off by LinkedIn.  I attempted to cancel my subscription to Sales Navigator immediately. Guess what??

We can view their profile, see what they've posted and find a way to engage. So, by following prospects this gives us a way to detect when they are active. [What a useful hack for those who don't have Sales Navigator :-) ]  3. There is then a section listing all the company pages we follow. No real value here, except to unfollow those who are of no further interest.  4. Below Company Pages there's a section listing all the other people who have posted nothing in the last week. This could be an opportunity to unfollow people who are no longer of interest, who don't post, and may not even log on and view content on #LinkedIn either.   What do you think Craig M.

Just because you use a number of filters to select people who fit your sales strategy, e.g. industry, location and job title, are they really 'leads'? Not in my book. They may be 'targets' but a lead is surely someone you have at least met! In professional services, successful selling is still about building personal relationships and you do this face-to-face not in cyberspace. Alright, knowing that one of your LinkedIn connections knows your target may help facilitate an introduction, but most of what Sales Navigator is offering is just 'cold calling' and we all know how useless this is as a sales strategy in the PSF sector!","118","Owner","Business Development","Unknown","Europe","Male","771","60","51-200","55"

I assumed that there would be many similarities between cold investor outreach and cold B2B SaaS outreach.   While there are certainly a number of similarities, there are also unexpected differences.   The biggest issue I've noticed is the absolute REQUIREMENT for automation in the prospecting process (CRM, activity tracking, prospecting, etc.).   With tools like Zapier, Salesforce, Geckoboard, Ecquire, Ring Central, Sales Navigator, and Interseller, you can almost automate your entire prospecting process.

"81379246778504416"," With the help of Sales Navigator, Zubradt says that Crane Worldwide is now seeing a reduction of three to six months in their average sales cycle. “Everyone sees value in Sales Navigator,” says Zubradt.  Sales Navigator has become so important to the Crane team, that it’s now a part of the way they evaluate sales reps. “There are five criteria we use with our salespeople in their quarterly reviews – new accounts, active accounts, etc.,” says Zubradt. “But one of those five is their Social Selling Index (SSI) score from Sales Navigator, and that’s because it encourages reps to boost their skills, not just their numbers.” By regularly checking their SSI scores and practicing the sales behaviors that will increase them, everyone on the team is improving their skill set and the way they drive business.  Zubradt says that, by connecting with multiple team members at an organization, he managed to maintain an account even after their primary contact left the company. “I went on Sales Navigator and found five other people to connect with, two of whom I was connected to through friends. By leveraging all of those connections, we held onto the business and continued to drive things forward with the account.”   Case study here: https://lnkd.in/fsVFgTM  ","207","Entry","Support","Unknown","Asia","Female","1293","61","unknown","72"

"123565908196353671","Is It Worth Buying B2B Data? (3 Services I Use)   If you've been doing prospecting and cold emailing for a while you are going to ask: is it worth buying B2B data?   I'm going to go over three services that I pay for right now and talk about the pros and cons of each.  1. Email Hunter  pros: -super easy to use -great for beginners -cheap  cons: -high bounce rate -50% of the time there won't be an email listed  It's worth starting on, if you haven't bought a lot of data before.  2. LinkedIn Sales Navigator  pros: -complete and accurate data -everybody is on LinkedIn  cons: -it doesn't give you the email address of your prospect. LinkedIn wants you to connect with them through their platform  Sales Navigator is good in combination with something like Email Hunter to identify the actual prospect.  3.

Summary: Start with Email Hunter. If it works, perfect, it's cheap. Then add Sales Navigator and us it in combination with Email Hunter to get that high quality data. If all fails, go somewhere like ZoomInfo and get more data.","224","Manager","Arts and Design","Unknown","North America","Male","3361","72","unknown","72"

"96829760411127308","After wondering for years why anyone would pay a dime for LinkedIn - I ponied up for a paid Sales Navigator.   1. It is like LinkedIn without all the connections to people you don’t know because YOU select who shows in your feed.   2. Easily uncover job changes at the executive level.   3. Uncover great content shares from important people and bypass a lot of promotional posts.   4. Follow companies that are leads to uncover changes and new staff.   5.  See at a glance which of your followed companies are growing and which are shrinking by employee count %.  6. None of my competitors seem to do this  Downside:  1. Expensive - around $800 yearly  2. Paid status seems to attract some users who know that if you’re paying you are paying attention to LinkedIn.   3.  The pricing and features are really hidden within LinkedIn and not easy to find.   4.  There are cheaper levels I may be able to take advantage of in the future.   5.  LinkedIn is still very much “recruiter city” and if they don’t continue to pay attention to other areas I’ll likely reconsider when renewal time approaches.","192","VP","Sales","Tech & Media","North America","Male","1803","73","51-200","84"

There's no denying we were a little biased... But let's get into it.   In the end, you'll always have a preference from whether your business is B2B or B2C. Instagram's e-commerce platform, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator are both powerful tools.   But there was one even bigger factor to consider: quality.   How many automated Instagram accounts are there with 20,000 followers? Tens of thousands! How many LinkedIn accounts? A fraction of that.   In our opinion, having 20k on LinkedIn will make you stand out far more than Instagram.   Building up 20,000 followers on LinkedIn takes time.

Definition: Management is the function that coordinates the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives by using available resources efficiently and effectively.  Process: Management has 5 key tasks, being: • Planning • Organising • Staffing • Directing  • Controlling  Take a moment to think about this process cycle: Are you spending time on all tasks? Where are your strengths in this process? On a scale of 1-5 (5 being mastery) where would you score in each task?  Ask yourself: Why am I behaving like this? What is the impact of my score on my Management result? What can I do to improve at this task?  The implication of scoring low on any task in this cycle can significantly affect your Management results.

Definition: Management is the function that coordinates the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives by using available resources efficiently and effectively.  Process: Management has 5 key tasks, being: • Planning • Organising • Staffing • Directing  • Controlling  Take a moment to think about this process cycle: Are you spending time on all tasks? Where are your strengths in this process? On a scale of 1-5 (5 being mastery) where would you score in each task?  Ask yourself: Why am I behaving like this? What is the impact of my score on my Management result? What can I do to improve at this task?  The implication of scoring low on any task in this cycle can significantly affect your Management results.   Over the coming weeks The Whole Thing is going to explore Management as a trigger to help motivate you to improve as a Manager (boss) and business leader.  #leader #leadership #management #strategicthinking #organisationaldevelopment  #highperformance #thewholething  -- Photo by LinkedIn Sales Navigator","201","VP","Business Development","Prof Services","Middle East","Male","3703","60","11-50","69"

"117703824977564663","Interesting perspective, however the challenge is that ""Microsoft Relationship Sales"" (Dynamics 365 for Sales +  LinkedIn Sales Navigator) is ignoring what drives adoption and enthusiasm. In classic Microsoft tradition this is a forced bundle, instead of the SalesForce.com ""open"" approach where apps and services must ""earn"" their value & engagement with professionals. When it comes to opening-up or transferring one's black book to a service that is controlled by your employer it gets very sensitive and very tricky. Microsoft would be well-advised to slow down & observe Marc Benioff's approach.","90","Owner","Entrepreneurship","Finance & Ins.","North America","Male","2949","66","1-10","78"

I was then charged immediately for this and when I immediately canceled I was told that the service would be canceled after the 1st month. Noting about a refund.  The next working day I received a patronizing standard email saying that they were sorry to see me leaving and hoped I come back soon. WTF?  If you really want to sell premium services let people trial the service and let the service prove its worth.

"142140665796112338","I keep getting asked by sales leaders how they can be leveraging LinkedIn to get opportunities. This platform is too important to ignore!  Here are a few thoughts. I will be putting out a longer video series on this topic, and will be using Facebook Live to answer questions as a follow up (for anyone who has them). 100% free, of course.   1) Follow Gary Vaynerchuk - he is, bar none, the authority on all things social media marketing.  2) Pay the $64/month to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to build a lead list. This is a cornerstone piece - you're going to do a bunch with this list.   3) Use Email Hunter and Google research to find emails, addresses, and phone numbers for your target contacts - and still leverage traditional prospecting (I recommend email, phone, handwritten note for mid-market + package sequences for enterprise).  4) Post ORIGINAL CONTENT 4-6x/week - it's ok if you want to curate articles or share others' posts, but make sure to share your own commentary as well. Try to mix up message and medium (written, picture, video). And engage your prospects posts!   5) Run paid LinkedIn ads against your Sales Navigator list - even if they don't click, you're getting great impressions. You can even run an advertisement for a video from you as the salesperson!   #socialselling","222","CXO","Business Development","Prof Services","North America","Male","3278","68","1-10","73"

It's just an example of LinkedIn's crappy search, which not only is inconvenient in tools like Sales Navigator but costs advertising money with poor targeting.   This is the digital version of “I know that half of my advertising dollars are wasted, I just don’t know which half.”  This particular result comes up if you search for CEOs in the Boston area in companies with 50-1000 employees.   One person is the real CEO.  One person is in the office of the CEO. (Okay, at least ""CEO"" was in their title at the company, so that’s understandable.)  And one person works at the company but is the CEO of another company with fewer than 10 employees.   It’s this third case which is especially annoying because it happens all the time.   It makes searches less useful, and it means that some of your ad spend on LinkedIn is wasted – maybe a lot of it.   LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft, which has some of the most sophisticated search technology in the world. It can’t do better than that? ","193","Senior","Unknown","Unknown","North America","Male","1694","69","unknown","81"

Maybe I am wrong but my understanding has been that LinkedIn is not just about connecting and networking but also about the opportunity it offers to generate new business.   LinkedIn actively promote this thought by offering subscription services such as LinkedIn Sales Navigator, aimed specifically at sales people with the aim of generating leads and business  With this in mind, what do you think is the best approach? Is it all about HOW you are approached? Is it all about how relevant or well crafted and researched the message is?   The way we work is changing so rapidly and what was great yesterday is not always so great today.  I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions, tell us what you think?  ","162","Senior","Sales","Tech & Media","Europe","Male","738","66","1001-5000","62"

In today's short video, I discuss the 4 components of the SSI and how to access your score through Sales Navigator (For those without Sales Navigator, I've dropped a link in the comments section below).  So, why is this SSI rank even relevant?   Because the buyer's journey has changed. 91% of buyers now want to engage with businesses online before agreeing to an in-person sales or phone meeting.   Therefore, service professionals (consultants, advisors, sales, marketing etc.) must adopt a more social approach to selling by building trust and relationships and the LinkedIn SSI is a good guide.   Check out the short video below and discover how you compare to those in your industry and network from a social selling perspective.   James __________  P.S. My Linkedin Social Selling group coaching program for business owners and service professionals kicks off shortly. Together, we'll build out your social selling campaign.   A campaign that promotes your professional brand and generates inbound inquiries from people interested in your prduct/services. A campaign that takes just 30 mnutes to manage each day (or outsource if you want).   Message me privately for more details.   #LinkedInTips #30DS ","194","Senior","Marketing","Prof Services","Europe","Male","6223","64","myself only","84"

"106663490360574602","After finishing another well attended edition of our social selling intro workshops, I was asked once again about how relevant Twitter is now in the B2B Space. My reply...   Twitter is a spent force when it comes to Social Selling. The platform has it’s uses for journalists, live events and of course Presidents, but for the average business owner or Marketing manager, there is no real ROI.    Why do I think This?  Fundamentally Twitter suffers because it has no filter, essentially it is the internet version of standing in a busy train station and shouting as loudly as you can about your product. It also lacks in depth prospecting tools which is crucial in the Social Selling process. For example, you are unable to access the wealth of information you can on Sales Navigator using Twitter's dashboard. The direct messaging (DM) feature is also better served on Instagram as the social media platform is no longer reserved for young people, in fact it has seen its biggest growth with the 45+ demographic over the last 18 months. If you want to prospect, get a decent account up and DM your buyers with links to some engaging content.

Simple reason:  I have been trying to get back control over my LinkedIn account.  End of last week I received multiple emails from LinkedIn informing me that my account has been closed, apparently somebody was able to access my profile and create havoc.  Some connections lost. All endorsements received and given lost.  Relationship work of years down the drain. When your #SSI nose-dives from 86% to 72% within a few days, you know something is going terribly wrong.   Since there is no way to get in touch with a person on the phone, I had to wait for response via the Helpcenter. During the process I was asked to change my password. Three times. Identify myself with passport and ID.  My account is still not fully restored.  Seems that the Helpcenter cannot easily resolve the issues or just roll back my profile to what it was.   As for many of you LinkedIn and Sales Navigator are part of what you do, engaging with experts, clients, colleagues.

"113667191032571238","Sales Navigator is a goldmine.   But there's a problem.  There's this feature, that's super awesome to 'hijack' your competitor's clients. But it's not really well known, and it is not really easy to use.  Its the technology filter section on the Sales Navigator Accounts page.  It lets you search for companies (accounts) that use specific technologies / tools/ softwares.  So for example, if you're a web hosting company, and want to find out who your competitor's clients are, you can use this tool to find out companies that use AWS, Azure etc.  The problem is, the above keywords are well known, so its easy to search for them. But there are 2500+ tech filters that you can filter by, but LinkedIn only shows you top 5 options based on your search query.  So ... If you want to get the entire 2500+ technology keywords list that you can filter accounts by, just comment below with a 'I want it' and I will send you the file.","166","CXO","Information Technology","Health & Pharm.","Asia","Male","11582","74","1-10","78"

"133104929823634447","Is #LinkedIn #SalesNavigator Worth It? ... I was asked this question by the Sales Leader of a Tech firm earlier today. He is leading a 20 strong sales team in Au/NZ. It was a good 1-hour chat over coffee. In my opinion, #SocialSelling is bigger than #LinkedIn. However, #LinkedIn is the centrepiece of B2B Social Selling. #Twitter is an excellent Social Selling tool. #Google has its own benefits. However, #LinkedIn is the centrepiece. LinkedIn's professional product for Sales - 'Sales Navigator' is a very small investment to make (about $100 a month per sales rep) for a mammoth return. $5/day to ensure that the sales professional is working with the right accounts and the right contacts at the right time in the right way. No-Brainer really.  So Yes, Social Selling extends beyond the LinkedIn platform (way beyond), but without Sales Nav you are missing the CORE, the ENGINE, the SOUL of Social Selling.  So if you have 20 Sales Reps, LinkedIn Sales Nav is an investment of about $100/day across 20 people, but the return you will get for that investment is unbelievably high.

"135884873255629298","Quick question... Looking for a data source that will allow me to build a list of target accounts with headcount growth criteria.  For example: Companies with 200-1000 employees that have increased headcount by 10% or more in the past 12 months.  I would've thought that Linkedin Sales Navigator would make that easy, but I tried and failed.   Does someone have a solution?  PS. Also, I just tried Prospect.io and their email data looks good so far. I'll report results soon. If someone else has a way to find emails from just a name + company + linkedin profile....

"103920876215576953","Linkedin Ads: why they don't work...  ...but LinkedIn offers a MUCH BETTER product!  Let's face it, there are two kind of people on LinkedIn:  1] People trying to hire or get hired  2] People interested in B2B opportunities, be it B2B sales, finding an investor, a way to speak at a conference...  3] People who are bored, looking for news...  Ok, that's 3 categories.  Actually, the third category probably has the most active users.  SO, if you're here for HIRING or getting B2B SALES, your ads will mostly be shown to people that are browsing LinkedIn in order to find latest trend in their industry, engage with other professionals etc...  That's why a direct response ad is very unlikely to perform well. Also, the fact that they have awful CPM and very low CTR doesn't help.  I tried both hiring and getting sales through LinkedIn, and every time Facebook ads were more effective, even for hunting CXOs and promoting Investment Funds.  That's when their second product comes into play: SALES NAVIGATOR  The targeting options are just as powerful as for their ad platform.  But you get the opportunity to PERSONALLY engage with your ideal prospect.  As an USER, are you more likely to ENGAGE with a display banner, or with a personalized message sent to your inbox?   How are you using LinkedIn?","222","Senior","Marketing","Unknown","Asia","Male","982","70","unknown","53"

There is so much opportunity for companies who learn how to communicate and collaborate effectively internally across functions.  From my experience, sales complain that marketing does not understand what is needed, in terms of content, to drive new business deals through the sales cycle and deepen relationships with existing accounts.  From my experience, sales cannot articulate exactly what they need to marketing. Nor can they provide marketing with the right people for ABM to be truly effective. Marketing is often just provided with a list of random names and then complain that marketing is adding no value.  Here’s the deal. Many sales people have never been taught how to conduct effective account planning into their accounts. They don't know how to conduct the right research, and then find, relate and engage with the right people deep and wide within a target account across the consensus purchase.

As highlighted in tip #2, being prepared before placing calls to prospects is also crucial. Other ways in which you can gain insights into your prospect, include using LinkedIn's Sales Navigator to identify the key decision maker and checking the company website and blogs. You'll learn about what they do, what potential pain points they might have, and how you can match your product or service to alleviate them. It's also important that you check the contact centre software to see if there's been any prior contact with the prospect.   Good leads are hard to come by, or at least expensive to generate, so being prepared significantly improves the success rate, and if you've done your homework right, you'll also have prepared tailored objection handling tactics.

"109330242514297987","Top 7 reasons to switch from ZoomInfo to LeadIQ:  1) ZoomInfo has credit limits so it's a pain for reps to have to watch their usage and worry about going over the limit, then having to buy more credits if they go over. LeadIQ = unlimited emails and unlimited exporting to CRM.   2) LeadIQ is less expensive -- so you get more leads for less $   3) ZoomInfo has direct dials, but how often to people answer their desk phone? I don't even have a desk phone. Sure, LeadIQ has direct dials, but our data is even stronger for cell phones. So our customers have a 3x higher connect rate on cold calls.   4) LeadIQ has a capture all button. Capture an entire LinkedIn search results page (25 leads on Sales Navigator, 10 leads on regular LinkedIn) with one click. With ZoomInfo reps have to capture leads 1 at a time = inefficient.   5) LeadIQ does real-time data capture so as soon as someone changes a job we already have their new contact info. ZoomInfo is a static database that lags behind. People change jobs more frequently than ever, so this is huge.   6) With LeadIQ you can capture leads for people who liked your LinkedIn post with one click. ZoomInfo can't do this.   7) LeadIQ has data on what tech your target accounts are using, ZoomInfo does not.

"129703964887940867","So far this month I’ve had over 250K views on my posts.  If you’re struggling to get reach here’s my TOP 4 tips:  1) Get super clear on your target market and then use Sales Navigator to find, invite and connect with them. This will help you build a network of targeted contacts to position your content in front of.  2) Stay on topic, the key to getting reach on LinkedIn is engagement and the key to engagement is posting content that your target market want to like, comment or share.  Think about topics they would be excited to read about or can relate to. Then start writing posts around these topics.  3) Be vulnerable and raw in everything you write, don’t be afraid to express yourself. This is absolutely key to engagement and a must to build trust with your audience. Without engagement your reach will be limited.  4) Be patient, so many people give up before they even start. I averaged less than 1000 views per post when I first started. But I stayed at it and consistently posted week in week out.  Which tip was your favorite?

It’s the essence of networking after all, isn’t it?  * Don’t try to ask for a job just because he who you connected with, works there the last 5 yrs. Really?  * Don’t connect and try to sell to your new connection. OK Venus, Mars, now Saturn… (I’ll let you in on a little secret: LI has launched an entire division for that called Sales Navigator so it is DEFINITELY OK)   That’s like 80-90% of why professional networks exist and why many more are created every day.

"111268242735396719","Tuned into (is that the right phrase?!) an interesting Social Selling webinar by Fullscope and Microsoft last week, hosted by Fullscope MD Adam Spurr.  They recently surveyed their customers who are using Dynamics (other CRM platforms are available!) integrated with LinkedIn's Sales Navigator.   The metrics are compelling  - Average increase in deal size is 35% (55% for top quartile) - Average increase in win rates is 5% (15% for top quartile) - Average increase in sourced opportunities is 34% (45% for top quartile)  Taking the average for the first metric above, the increase in revenue on 10 deals at a current average deal size of £20k would be £70k (10x£27k=£270k as opposed to 10x£20k=£200k)  That's probably worth consideration.  The essence of the increase is due to having a more complete view of who the potential buyers are in future customers and how to connect to them through your network.    If we equate a more strategic sale to playing chess, you wouldn't play chess with only being able to see one or two of the pieces (partial view).  That would be nonsense. You would want to see the whole board.  The complete view facilitates higher and wider engagement to build greater value and hence create bigger sales opportunities. All managed efficiently in CRM.            ","212","Owner","Business Development","Prof Services","Europe","Male","1726","61","unknown","66"

It is like passing the keys of a brand new 4X4 to someone who does not even drive much offroad.   In another instance, you might have the world's greatest product/services that even your closest competitor is not able to compete with you, but you are not marketing it as much as you should be, hence the result is not as brilliant as you would like it to be.   Just imagine Lewis Hamilton driving a go kart to race with Formula 3 racers who are driving the elite super cars. He has got the skills but his machine is not taking him to places.   Marketing is exactly like that.

"93203222603466711","FYI,  the industry category search with LinkedIn recruiter is based on individual profiles and the industries people select for their profiles.  This is only as accurate as the industries people select.  An example is a person goes into the staffing industry and selects staffing & recruiting as their industry but 2 years later leave to pursue a different career.  Many people forget to update the industry section of their profiles when changing careers.  Or, an accountant might select accounting as their industry but work for Microsoft which is a technology company.  With LinkedIn Sales Navigator, there are a few issues.  First, how does LinkedIn know what industry a company is in? Is the LinkedIn system looking at industry categories on individual profiles? Not sure how accurate that is when searching for companies in specific industries.  Another issue with Sales Navigator is if you search a city, then select an industry and also select number of employees there is a technical glitch.  The search pulls people from the industry but uses ""Global"" number of employees instead of number of employees in that city.  As I test ideas with LinkedIn, I will share what I learn here to help those of you in my contact network.

These lists need to be qualified.  How can you find a lead bucket for your business? How can you find people that are going to have a need for what you offer?  The first place I always recommend going for is job boards, but AngelList is a little bit overused. The second place is going to LinkedIn sales navigator and coming up with a criteria that matches.  This is the biggest step in this process.  #2: Hire and train to build lead lists [2:10]  The exact job posting we use on upwork to get lead generators. [2:22] We hired 8 freelancers using this job posting.  What to look for in a candidate?  We then send people to my YouTube videos for training. Example of our video training.

The thing to look at with LinkedIn Sales Navigator is Lead Builder. [0:54]  You take your ideal client profile and you can put them in here and find the types of leads you’re looking for.  For Experiment 27 we’re always looking for founders at digital agencies, so we need. Geography: United States. Title: CEO founder managing director. 51 to 200 people and also 200-500. Digital agency is the keyword. And it looks like we have 6,409 results.  All the info you need is their name and website. And then use the add-ons we talked about previously to split the names and get the email addresses. And that's how easy it is.  You can have your VAs or yourself go through any of these lead lists and the only thing worth tweaking is coming up with the right searches to find the highest quality leads.  Sales Navigator's pretty good but you still have to make sure you check everything to be sure that it’s solid.  Let me know if you want me to run through your lead criteria.

Here are a few areas where Microsoft has made an impact in this release, only available to Gartner clients:  *Dynamics 365 for Sales has revamped mobile and tablet capabilities, which is significant because mobility is a core need for sales force automation (SFA) solutions.   *Dynamics 365 for Sales provides Office 365 and LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration for syncing data between applications, thus differentiating itself in the market.   *The newly added sales productivity features in Dynamics 365 for Sales enhance the management of long B2B and B2C sales cycles.   *Dynamics 365 for Sales has an improved drag-and-drop business process flow designer within the visual process designer tool, which aims to optimize end-to-end sales processes and increase sales efficiency.","168","Senior","Research","Tech & Media","North America","Male","510","67","10001+","58"

"129703964887940867","“Why are my posts on LinkedIn getting NO traction?”  A question I get asked all the time.  When you share a status update it goes through a few stages based on LinkedIn’s algorithm.  First and foremost they check the quality of your content and label it as spam, low quality or clear.  Once it’s cleared LinkedIn will then send it to a small segment of your network to see how well it performs.  Based on the likes, comments and shares you get from this initial push, it will determine the popularity of your post.  The lower your score the less reach and vise versa.  If your post continues to get engagement it will be sent out to more of your network and so on...  Now the reason why you’re probably not getting traction is because your network is built up of people who:  a) Don’t know you b) Not your target market  Therefore the posts you put up aren’t relevant or targeted to get the early traction it needs.  So what’s the solution?  1. Get clear on your target market. 2. Use ‘Sales Navigator’ to search, find and connect with them. 3. Send invitations to that audience on a daily basis.  Over time this will ensure that you build a network that’s targeted and relevant.

This will help you build a network of targeted contacts to position your content in front of.  2) Stay on topic, the key to getting reach on LinkedIn is engagement and the key to engagement is posting content that your target market want to like, comment or share.  Think about topics they would be excited to read about or can relate to. Then start writing posts around these topics.  3) Be vulnerable and raw in everything you write, don’t be afraid to express yourself. This is absolutely key to engagement and a must to build trust with your audience. Without engagement your reach will be limited.  4) Be patient, so many people give up before they even start.

Think about topics they would be excited to read about or can relate to. Then start writing posts around these topics.  3) Be vulnerable and raw in everything you write, don’t be afraid to express yourself. This is absolutely key to engagement and a must to build trust with your audience. Without engagement your reach will be limited.  4) Be patient, so many people give up before they even start. I averaged less than 1000 views per post when I first started. But I stayed at it and consistently posted week in week out.  Which tip was your favorite?

"78589184675278149",""" In teaching, you learn"" - words told to me by my grandfather that I keep forever.  Last week we conducted our 3+ hours LinkedIn Workshop 101. A day full of learning & growing.  Some of the takeaways learned by our attendees :  ➡️Video is Gold - No secrets! But keeping your video short, having texts on it & consistency in content & timing is key ➡️Utilizing articles - Sharing your articles through short posts with CTA can help drive increased engagement ➡️Lead Gen - Sales Navigator, warm leads, targetted content are some of the best methods within LinkedIn for lead gen. ➡️Profile Optimization- Profiles that are 100% completed ( photo, headline, summary, etc) are better optimized for search results. ➡️Engagement is everything - Never forget to interact with your community.    and more...  We even went through everyone's LinkedIn profile to provide tactical feedback.   Kudos to Angelo Kwek Muema Lombe joyce cho David Jacob Mannukaden Dante Alabastro for attending & taking the first step to rocking LinkedIn Big shout out to Eden Golan for helping make it successful & Qianhui Chia for hosting us.

LinkedIn announced that its Sales Navigator tool would integrate with its Campaign Manager to help marketers improve targeting—a move that monetizes its massive amount of data for sales and marketing purposes.

"81379246778504416","Three ways that LinkedIn Sales Navigator can help you prospect into complex accounts:  1.	Map your account Using the Advanced Search and Lead Builder features in LinkedIn, you can search by company name, seniority level, functional area and key word to develop a list of potential decision makers. Often by a little inspection and research we can find out who the key person we need to meet with and learn about their background, and gather insight into who has influence in the organization.  2.	Messaging Using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, we can follow the company and capture the key decision makers as Leads, which will allow us to get individual “Lead Updates” and “Lead Shares” from these prospects. Our goal is to learn about what they are interested in and what they care about, gather clues and intelligence about the person and their business. This can help us develop key message and a value proposition that is unique to the prospect.  3.	Gain access  When you have a solid network on your LinkedIn account, you can simply click on ‘2nd degree connections’ within Sales Navigator to identify whom in your target audience is connected to your immediate network for an introduction.  ","197","Entry","Support","Unknown","Asia","Female","1293","61","unknown","72"

"94752246164496644","Dear Marketers. Happy #GDPR day!  As you wake up today mourning the loss of all your “subscribers” that were actually elated to be opted out of your email list. Consider #LinkedIn as your new data set to engage and nurture your audiences.  LinkedIn should not be thought of as a “social media channel” where you “go amplify” the same content across all your social channels.  Find your audience through one of the most impressive data sets available to us. Then engage with them in a conversation, consistently over time with helpful content.  Not by putting banner ads in their feed or only asking for that coveted gated form fill.  It’s a technology platform that can enable your sales and marketing #digitaltransformation. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. LinkedIn Elevate. LinkedIn Sponsored Content. Employer Branding. Employee Advocacy. If you don’t know what these are I urge you to find out.  Let’s use GDPR day to remember the day we committed to developing a LinkedIn content strategy.","162","Senior","Sales","Tech & Media","Europe","Female","1194","70","10001+","81"

"79024518410210753","These days I found  in my mailbox an email from LinkedIn with a headline ""Let's celebrate your Sales Navigator success"".  It stated that I ranked among the top 5% of LinkedIn Sales Navigator users in 2017. Wow! Thank you, LinkedIn for this recognition!  I have to admit that Sales Navigator changed my habits and taught me about the power of social selling more than any other tool I ever had a chance to use. It helped me win the Oracle Social Selling Challenge last week.  I love the daily highlights I receive from people I want to be in touch with. I love the fact that I have all the relevant information about people, companies and industries in one place.  My favourite Sales Navigator feature is the top updates feed. This is my own personal sieve for the unnecessary noise  - try it guys!   #RealSales","142","Manager","Sales","Tech & Media","Europe","Female","1368","71","10001+","0"

Yes, you will have different hurdles during the journey but this tech age had made it really easy to compete with large organisations.   When I heard of this startup which can be a competitor or even better solution to Linkedin Sales Navigator  I was lIke what!!!!  This Startup had made a really good platform backed with AI & Machine Learning which Sales teams, Entrepreneurs, job seekers or even students can use to contact to their prospects in just clicks.   I really feel positive and motivated when someone creates such products from almost zero.   This startup has now customers from fortune 500 companies in just 6 months of time frame.   This startup is not from Silicon Valley or something but it's an Indian startup from Delhi who is surely going to be a big hit in near future.

This is my feedback concerning Sales Navigator and LinkedIn Pulse.   Eavan Healy If your role covers Sales Navigator.  And Daniel Roth  and Isabelle Roughol because you oversee LinkedIn publishing platform but Africa is clearly MIA.  These are my recommendations:   - The way sales navigator work, it may seem great for people in the West, but after using it, it's a bit limiting. Add multiple lead lists. A particular lead may be responsible for different opportunities.  There are African writers who can contribute to LinkedIn pulse we don't have to be Influencers. Also, with a committed editor that covers only the African market, it's easier to get great articles featured on LinkedIn publishing platform  These are just a few.  Thanks for listening.

"96929298586570676","Been listening to the LinkedIn webinar updates for Sales Navigator. Alex Pirouz, what do you think?   Few updates that you may find beneficial: 1) If you run a Sales Team  - Prospecting and contact regularity, and ability to sync with Salesforce to see the movement of the client is really good. - CRM-Like Functions are starting to come into Sales Navigator including where the team is with the actual contact AND the total deal amount  2) Wanting to do specialised campaigns to target markets:  (I think this is the best change)  - Ad Campaigns will integrate into Sales Navigator, so you can specifically put sponsored content to groups that you are targeting. - Best Part - if you are running a Sales Team - your business page can now specifically generate sponsored content to your sales team's pipeline.  Why this is a big deal?  The segmentation with LinkedIN in advertising is good, but no where near what Facebook can do.   B2B Biz - this is a massive move.   If Your sales reps don't go out of their way to nurture their pipeline - your content can.   3) InsideSales Integration - if you are running a call centre (mostly in the US), this is such a massive benefit. You can hook this into your phone system and automatically see the client contact sync via LinkedIN - on autodialler! ","226","Owner","Business Development","Unknown","Oceania","Female","3034","72","unknown","58"

Sales people understand the customer behavior and provide thoughtful and meaningful suggestions throughout the buying journey until the customer is ready to buy. Thus social selling allows the sales people to delight there prospects with content and permission marketing rather than interrupt their daily lives with cold calls and hard sells.  LinkedIn – The world’s largest professional network  LinkedIn is the most effective social selling network in the planet, with more than 530 million users in more than 200 countries and every two second 2 new LinkedIn accounts are created.  While Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat are valuable tools to learn more about your prospect’s interests and personality, these platforms are good to research about the prospect before reaching out, LinkedIn is typically the only platform that directly leads to new business.

"85213190128450587","Here are my LinkedIn prospecting tips that landed me 2 clients:  1. On a daily basis, check who has viewed your profile and reach out to connect with them. Also, when you are sending out invites, always write a personalized message and don't just send out the generic one.  2. When you are first connecting, don't be salesy at all. Try to connect with people by referencing something interesting about their profile.   3. Before Sales Navigator, I was just maximizing my searches with the free account. The benefit of having a premium account is that you can do more refined searches of people.  5. After someone has connected with you, write back and say thank you. I say, ""Let me know if you need help professionally in any way or want to chat about Facebook ads."" I sometimes just ask them how their week went to start a conversation.  6. Send out helpful news, articles, etc. to people in your network and post updates regularly. LinkedIn is great because if one of your contacts likes your update, their network may possibly see your posts.  9. Overall, be authentic, helpful and non-salesy - that will take you far on LinkedIn. Comment on other people's posts to gain exposure and don't try to push yourself on other people.  Do you guys have other tips? Add them in the comments below.","228","CXO","Business Development","Prof Services","North America","Female","2008","80","1-10","86"

So, it could be interesting to buy the LinkedIn Sales Navigator licence, but:   1/ not as a 1st step  2/ not without a specific training on how Social Selling can increase your sales performance    3/ not without learning how to align LinkedInSales Navigator with your specific #socialselling approach","97","Partner","Entrepreneurship","Prof Services","Europe","Female","2365","68","51-200","81"

So for you #sales pros doing outbound prospecting without an integrated CRM, how are you managing your workflow?   Best practices recommend a cadence of 9-12 touches using a mix of InMails, Connection Requests, direct emails, and phone calls.   So how are you keeping track of those touches?  It's only been a week, and I'm already losing track of where I am with each prospect.   Responses are getting buried. Prospects are falling through the cracks.   Message threads are hard to keep track of. Some message threads appear in Sales Navigator, some in the regular LinkedIn interface.   Do you manually enter the leads into your separate CRM?  How do you track/manage the workflow and cadence to ensure you're touching them enough to get a response before moving on?   How many leads do you work in a batch?   Would deeply appreciate tips, but please don't try to sell me a service. I'm not looking to outsource this and don't want to sign up for a training course.   Thanks!  #SalesNavigator #Prospecting #ABS #AccountBasedSelling #LinkedInTips #Funnel #socialselling #LinkedIn","205","CXO","Business Development","Prof Services","North America","Female","1838","74","1-10","89"

Here are some of my reasons:  1. People are curious beings and prefer following people, not companies or company pages. Esp. nowadays, we crave genuine connection, authenticity and flawsomeness - not the “fake perfection” we often see on business accounts.  2. I am a one-woman-show, so using my company page at this stage does not make much sense to me.   3. Instead of advertising through my LinkedIn company page (who likes seeing adverts in his news feed?), I prefer using LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find my ideal customers, which is SO much more powerful.

"129501782626044429","Interesting episode of #bufferpodcast on the LinkedIn potential for business in 2018: network and content-based, this platform is going to give marketers big opportunities... or not? Since Linkedin API aren't shared is difficult to integrate the platform into a social selling program if you don't get at least a sales navigator program and forcedly  use Salesforces or Hubspot.   Moreover, advertising on LinkedIn is still a jungle, at least here in Italy, as there is not enough experience or documentation to state how effective it is and the cost per click is so high that you have to aim at huge conversions to get an acceptable ROI.   Anyway, I'm passionate about Linkedin potential to connect people and, since Facebook Business Pages reach dropped significantly, let explore this platform.

"109246511500766369","#networking #thought  Dear #LinkedIn:   You're quite the amazing platform. On a daily basis, I strive to connect to others and establish great relationships on a global level that continue to grow day by day.   Sometimes, however, it is difficult to keep track of who's who, how I met someone (conference, digitally, etc) and their persona. This issue increased through grad school and now in the working world. This can be considered a ""customer"" pain point. I look for a way on this platform to take notes, update relationships status and more but I can't find this component.   It seems that you USED to have something like this but pulled it down to improve the user experience. You suggest to check out Recruiter Lite or Sales Navigator if I'm interested in some type of feature like this. I'm, however, not a recruiter or a sales professional. I'd love to simply connect and keep track to my connection.   Can you see about providing a personal networking CRM (type) feature? That'd be wonderful for all us professionals out there.   Sincerely,  Megan   ","176","Manager","Operations","Tech & Media","North America","Female","1193","67","10001+","54"

"105571006795171481","As Chief Visibility Officer at Vengreso | The Digital Sales Transformation Company, I wanted to show you what's new on LinkedIn’s Sales Navigator.  The new Sales Navigator profile looks a lot different. Some of the biggest changes are: 👉🏼On your Summary, only the first two lines show like they do on free LinkedIn. (When you click on “see more”, it's going to pop up the whole summary for you.) 👉🏼Notes, Tags and Messages used to be all up at the top right-hand side. But now Notes are under activity – a little hidden. Your tags are down underneath your profile details (experience and education.) 👉🏼Your contact information is on the right – and as with the old UI, you've got Twitter, WeChat and your websites. But there's no link back to LinkedIn. 👉🏼And where did the published posts go? (I hope this is not an indication that LinkedIn will be getting rid of the Publisher platform.) 👉🏼The related leads are apparently missing here as well.  While the changes won’t really affect the functionality of Sales Navigator, it might take a little getting used to! So I hope this video helps!  #LinkedInTips #VegresoVids #SalesNavigator  Mario M.

It's a super powerful tool for anyone looking to find and engage with decision makers & influencers.  With the new filters it is easier than ever 💪  2) InMail analytics  If you spend a lot of time writing InMail's, then it used to be quite frustrating to rely on gut feeling when evaluating your efforts.  That's not the case anymore 🤖  Now it's possible to:  - View response rate and performance over time  - What kind of candidates respond the most (based on time in role, schools, companies and more)  - How your response rate compares to industry benchmarks for similar recruiters  - Which InMail templates get the most responses  - Your entire team's performance  That's seriously powerful stuff. ⚡️ 🔥 💥  I've put a link in the comments if you want to know more about InMail analytics  Go get 'em 🚀🚀  Egil Andreu Gräs Clavel Jasko Besic Thomas Bøglund  (I'm hiring BDR's) Kristian Simonsen Mark Allan Martinussen Tim Stübe  Cheers /Casper","184","Senior","Program and Project Management","Tech & Media","Europe","Male","2126","73","51-200","76"

However, that communication can be scattered if you’re unable to remain organized while rushing from one appointment to the next. Dragon Anywhere, a spoken note dictation software, helps medical sales reps save time and stay organized. With a $14.99 app purchase for iPhone or iPad, reps can easily dictate documents while visiting with clients, hopping into the car, or even during a lunch break.  2. Sales Navigator No matter the size of your territory, time management is a major issue when it comes to staying productive and not wearing yourself down. Planning your week ahead of time is crucial for both time efficiency and lowering the cost of your expenses.  3. Expensify or Concur Even though keeping track of expenses comes with the job, it’s often looked at as a time-consuming nuisance.   4.

"109330242514297987","Top 6 reasons to switch from ZoomInfo to LeadIQ:  1) ZoomInfo has credit limits, it's a pain for reps to have to watch their usage, worry about going over the limit, then have to buy more credits if they go over. LeadIQ = unlimited emails & unlimited exporting to CRM.  2) LeadIQ is less expensive so you get more leads for less $  3) ZoomInfo has direct dials, but how often to people answer their desk phone? Sure, LeadIQ has direct dials, but our data is even stronger for cell phones. So our customers have a 3x higher connect rate on cold calls.  4) LeadIQ can capture entire LinkedIn search results page (25 leads on Sales Navigator, 10 leads on free LinkedIn) with 1 click. With ZoomInfo reps have to capture leads 1 at a time = inefficient.  5) LeadIQ is real-time data capture so if someone changes a job we already have their new contact info. ZoomInfo is more a of static database, lags behind. People change jobs more frequently than ever, so this is huge.  6) With LeadIQ capture leads for people who liked your LinkedIn post. ZoomInfo can't do this.  Attached is message from rep after his sales team switched from ZoomInfo to LeadIQ.   For a LeadIQ demo hit me up :) 👍🔥","216","Senior","Business Development","Tech & Media","North America","Male","5879","68","11-50","80"

The plant producing it started from the cut off top from a store bought one, it produced a pineapple and the top of that one is now producing!  The point is, that whether we are implementing a new process or technology into our systems we need to allow them the time to grow. We need to train our people on how to use it to increase productivity and we must always reevaluate how it’s being adopted within the organization.  At #utdsales our students just finished competing in a role play competition where they selling Sales Navigator to a company that recently canceled their contract with LinkedIn.   Their reasoning behind the cancellation was because it wasn’t being used, people who were using Navigator were unproductive, and they were having issues integrating with Salesforce.  All legitimate reasons for canceling right? Wrong, the organization in question never trained their people on the platform they simply said here use it. They never gave it enough time to beat fruit neither, so was it the platforms fault or the organization?

"126376620254347718","In a realm of often arbitrary and nonsensical employee titles, how does an SDR go about targeting the right demographics? From “Head Lead Champion” to “Special Engineering Specialist,” the decision of which individual deserves attention can be tricky, regardless of the amount of experience the prospector has.   While some titles lead to unavoidable wild-goose chases across Sales Navigator, others are more clear cut: we know what to do with “Director of Engineering,” “Chief Technology Officer,” and “QA Manager.” If properly categorized and mapped, the leads that give way to successful demos can paint a picture of the most effective contacts to reach out to. Not only does this improve the efficacy of our lead-selecting process and subsequent conversion to demos, it also saves us time that would be spent entertaining the wrong POCs.   Of the three main company areas that we search within, one of them generated 52% of successful leads; while, within the five titles prioritized in those areas, three of them served to make up 62% of successful demos. Essentially, this data has allowed us to hone in on our target demographics, trimming the bulk from three areas with five or more titles to one area with three titles, saving us time and improving our lead-to-demo conversion. ","209","Entry","Quality Assurance","Tech & Media","North America","Male","1078","66","11-50","70"

You know how to network. Your black book is bulging. Linkedin Sales Navigator is stretched to its limit and your phone is ringing off the hook. But you know you could be doing more.

"119126112767467190","""What Are They Talking About?"" Wednesday:  Yesterday I searched for a company name and its employees on LinkedIn and I received this message from LinkedIn:  ""Francine M., you're approaching the Commercial Use Limit.  Please upgrade to LinkedIn Premium, Business, Sales Navigator or Recruiter to get unlimited people browsing.""  What are they talking about -- I'm an unemployed job seeker, I'm not ""commercial"" anything.  I looked for an explanation on the website and LinkedIn writes:  ""Reaching the commercial use limit means your activity on LinkedIn is likely geared towards commercial purposes, like hiring or prospecting.  The commercial use limit is based on your search activity since the start of the current calendar month.  It takes into account (but is not limited to) non-name searches, mobile searches, searches outside your network, frequency of searches, viewing suggested profiles and other factors.""  It then goes on to explain the benefits of paying for LinkedIn's services.  That's what it comes to -- a well-written sales pitch.  LinkedIn is a job seeker's right arm, yet they're trying to hurt us by asking us to pay for it when they erroneously deem us a ""commercial user.""  It can't happen -- my budget doesn't allow it.  On to Plan B (C, D).
